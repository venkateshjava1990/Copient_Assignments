109,"[2015-05-03 00:20:13] <WikiLeaks> Although, if they want to tour the statue accross localities that are conservative, it makes sense to not draw attention to the sex issue."

154,[2015-05-03 01:09:42] <WikiLeaks> The 'historical' aspect is explicity mentioned on the site.

156,This is also motivated by the fact that the artist could not

1041,"[2015-05-26 06:39:00] <WikiLeaks> How does that work? Does he have it generally, who is paying for it? Or did he just pay extra for that case, as an insurance fee?"
1042,"[2015-05-26 06:39:53] <Cabledrum> It's 3 bills, one from the court and 2 from the lawyers. My lawyer already sent his bill to MGT today"

1045,"[2015-05-26 06:42:33] <Cabledrum> I don't know. Legal protection insurance is expensive. I guess, that he concluded an insurance after the PC case started"

1047,[2015-05-26 06:43:57] <WikiLeaks> He likely did so fraudulently if he paid for it himself. Insurance companies would want to know expected claims in advance.
1048,[2015-05-26 06:44:33] <WikiLeaks> The fees would be so high as to not make it worthwhile if they knew all his pending legal actions.
1049,"[2015-05-26 06:48:03] <Cabledrum> yes, that's why he sued me for the recent publications of his photo but ignored the publications of last year"
1050,[2015-05-26 06:57:06] <Cabledrum> Just for the records: MGT only lost the preliminary injunction now. The principal proceedings in this case goes on trial in October

1052,"[2015-05-26 08:03:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> It would be interesting to know the cost of legal insurance in Germany, esp. for someone who doesn't have a professional requirement for it."
1053,[2015-05-26 08:04:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> In the states Doctors are basically required to have malpractice insurance and it costs them a lot. Probably some other fields as well.

1058,"[2015-05-26 08:09:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> But I agree, if you win in October, best to get your costs paid ASAP before he wiggles out and/or the insurance co. drops him."

1141,[2015-06-01 17:20:42] <Cabledrum> I've just received the written reasons for the judgement on the annulment of the injunction. It says almost nothing.
1142,[2015-06-01 17:20:47] <Cabledrum> A preliminary injunction requires urgency and the only reason for the annulment is the lack of urgency in this case.

1257,[2015-06-04 15:34:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> There's always an observer bias of some kind. It's inescapable. The key is to 1. recognize you have it &amp; 2. Admit/disclose it.
1258,[2015-06-04 15:35:56] <LibertarianLibrarian> And the reader's responsibility is to read critically and evaluate how much bias and how much influence.

1404,[2015-06-11 11:52:19] <WikiLeaks> A new pro-independence paper has been founded.
1405,[2015-06-11 11:52:33] <WikiLeaks> The other Scottish papers now have to pretend to support Independence.

1423,"[2015-06-11 14:11:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> There's so much history b/w Scotland &amp; England, a lot of it quite bitter. I don't know if full independence is possible today, but some"
1424,[2015-06-11 14:12:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> will always want it.
1425,[2015-06-11 14:14:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don't know how the Scotland - UK relation works relative to US federal - state. Here there is always some tension over State rights.
1426,"[2015-06-11 14:15:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> After all, we fought a civil war over that, yes, it was about slavery too, but really it was states rights vs federal govt at core."
1427,"[2015-06-11 14:16:33] <LibertarianLibrarian> The 10th Amendment and states' rights may be much quieter now than before but it's still an issue, i.e. re Marijuana legalization now."
1428,[2015-06-11 14:17:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wonder what the SNP would consider feasible now short of full independence; how much separation would satisfy them and their supporters.
1429,[2015-06-11 14:25:26] <Emmy B> I remember our conversations in Earls Court about US Jenny __ learned a lot including not all higher education or healthcare is private.
1430,[2015-06-11 14:26:21] <Emmy B> Are such matter decided at state level or federal level? and who collects the taxes?
1431,"[2015-06-11 14:28:31] <Emmy B> Here in UK all direct and indirect taxes go to central gov with the exception of Council tax (police, local road maint rubish collection)"
1432,[2015-06-11 14:29:19] <Emmy B> which goes to the local government (borough/municipality level).
1433,[2015-06-11 14:30:40] <Emmy B> Scotland though gets to administer already how to spend central gov money within Scotland via the devolution agreement.
1434,[2015-06-11 14:33:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> That's part of the complicated nature of changing something like healthcare or education policy in the US. Each State can make policy.
1435,"[2015-06-11 14:34:27] <Emmy B> I see! very difficult then, the Constitution does not mention anything about education for example?"
1436,"[2015-06-11 14:34:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> You pay federal taxes and in most states you pay state taxes. Some states don't have income tax, but collect by sales tax, property tax, etc"

1441,"[2015-06-11 14:36:40] <LibertarianLibrarian> Some states have tried their own health insurance programs, with varied success and mostly failure. Tennessee's state health insurance"
1442,"[2015-06-11 14:37:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> went belly up more than once. Got sued by Hospitals for millions in nonpayment. Mass is supposed to be a bit better, varies."
1443,[2015-06-11 14:38:09] <LibertarianLibrarian> Different states and even more local areas can try out different education approaches to some degree.
1444,"[2015-06-11 14:38:46] <Emmy B> such a big country so many states, surely some 'got it right' ?"
1445,[2015-06-11 14:38:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> The federal govt uses the funds it gives the states to pressure states to go along with federal mandates.
1446,[2015-06-11 14:39:13] <Emmy B> mandates about what?
1447,"[2015-06-11 14:39:51] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not many that I know of, problems include lack of funds to pay for it at state level, lack of enough primary care providers, many things."
1448,"[2015-06-11 14:41:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> But, for example, when Obamacare went through, states could choose to expand Medicare/Medicaid or not, some did, some didn't. Some are"

1454,"[2015-06-11 14:45:03] <LibertarianLibrarian> It's not always easy for the fed govt to overrule states, look at Marijuana legalization now. Feds trying to make it stop but failing."
1455,"[2015-06-11 14:46:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> I remember big fights b/w states &amp; fed govt over speed limits. Speed limits on highways vary state to state, but years ago fed govt"

1457,[2015-06-11 14:47:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> NY still has 55 but FL was 70 mostly.
1458,[2015-06-11 14:48:43] <Emmy B> So this is an example of the mandates you were talking about earlier?
1459,"[2015-06-11 14:48:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Seems like silly issues, but permanent tension. So I look at Scotland situation through US lens, need learn more of their perspective."

1461,"[2015-06-11 14:50:17] <Emmy B> But, do you have any 'national' or 'ethnic' issues among states? I know it is all America but are there ethnic distinctions at all?"
1462,[2015-06-11 14:51:23] <WISE Up Wales> I suppose we only have to look to Ireland to see just how low Brits will stoop to hinder independence. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYF5_z3zmPw&amp;feature=youtu.be
1463,"[2015-06-11 14:52:08] <LibertarianLibrarian> It's not really ethnic differences but cultural differences, except in certain places. Some places like south florida, South Cali, South Tx"

1469,"[2015-06-11 14:59:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think we have a problem, due to size, of the lowest common denominator getting nationally elected. Hard to escape huge mass media at that"

1471,"[2015-06-11 15:00:04] <Emmy B> We keep talking about US this US that, really, we mean the federal gov ie the politicians that govern. Still, the represent the people."
1472,[2015-06-11 15:00:50] <LibertarianLibrarian> Very difficult to mass appeal across so many varied cultures and attitudes and belief systems.
1473,[2015-06-11 15:01:18] <LibertarianLibrarian> So gets watered down to mass stupidity.
1474,[2015-06-11 15:01:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> But that's why state and local govts have as much power as they do.

2841,"[2015-07-25 00:23:13] <Emmy B> this is curious as there is no distance at all between Crete and Incirilik, why would they need to stop off at Crete for e.g. refuelling."

2871,[2015-07-25 10:38:23] <WikiLeaks> We don't want to be presecriptive or there may be duplication.

3134,"[2015-08-18 05:26:09] <WikiLeaks> Models Valenti is likely looking to exploit are Nicklas Kristof's ""news dressed as opinion"" attack on Woody Allen, Gamer Gate, and the recent campus rape debate in US, where she made the following telling claim:"

3136,"<p>I choose to believe Jackie. I lose nothing by doing so, even if I’m later proven wrong—but at least I will still be able to sleep at night for having stood by a young woman who may have been through an awful trauma. """
3137,"[2015-08-18 05:30:55] <WikiLeaks> Jackie was subsequently shown to be a fraud, but Valenti was correct to say ""I lose nothing by doing so, even if I'm later proven wrong"".

3143,[2015-08-18 05:40:22] <WikiLeaks> media rhetoric strips the applicant to imprison of agency and requisite seriousness on what is proposed
3144,"[2015-08-18 05:44:00] <WikiLeaks> The Valenti article may help in the medium term. Although it's clearly geared to avoid discussing the merits, for obvious reasons, it may lead to a discussion on the merits, and the greater threats against JA's family which would be very positive."

3155,"[2015-08-18 05:55:53] <WikiLeaks> However, look at how it works in practice. The accused is up against a state funded team from the prosecution, another from the police, and, say in JA's case, another two state funded lawyers for the accusers."
3156,"[2015-08-18 05:56:44] <Emmy B> I thought she was a Christian Syriac from (what is now) Turkey, Active within the Syriac Community of Sweden."
3157,"[2015-08-18 05:57:36] <Emmy B> A media Lawyer, political connections."
3158,[2015-08-18 05:58:17] <WISE Up Action> It doesn't take 5 seconds to see that is an obvious abuse of justice. Imagine it being a black geezer in the States and a white complainant.
3159,"[2015-08-18 05:58:55] <WikiLeaks> In terms of the process and law, there's only three things the state funded accusers lawyers can do:"
3160,"<p>1) massage the text of the complaint to ensure it has all the necessay elements to secure a conviction. In Sweden that&#82#8217;s strong, since the ""complaint"" can always be resubmitted."
3161,"[2015-08-18 06:00:22] <WikiLeaks> 2) advice the accuser on how not to be convicted for false reporting, for example, asking for advice about an HIV test rather than making a complaint"
3162,"[2015-08-18 06:01:25] <WikiLeaks> 3) public relations. For example, nearly all of Borgstrom's bill was for speaking to journalists. Just for SW he billed for 80 hours of interviews. Normally lawyers do interviews for free, since it is free advertising for them."

3165,"[2015-08-18 06:03:22] <WikiLeaks> Fritz practice just does accusation work. Hence she's made a lot of money and expanded rapidly. As long as she can keep cases going and keep them in the spotlight, she makes more money."
3166,[2015-08-18 06:04:21] <Emmy B> A blatant disregard for the essence of justice
3167,"[2015-08-18 06:04:25] <WikiLeaks> She works closely with NY, who now handles all 'rape' cases in Sweden. Together thay tag-team the accused."
3168,[2015-08-18 06:04:50] <WISE Up Action> She's like a fifth rate US TV show
3169,"[2015-08-18 06:05:53] <Emmy B> Like Borgstrom and the Quick case in reverse, not really caring for their client in relation to real justice, just focusing on getting a judicial result irrespective of truth"
3170,[2015-08-18 06:06:52] <Emmy B> SW's interests as a person have certainly not been served by such protracted case and her own lawyer campaigning against JA being interviewed in London.
3171,[2015-08-18 06:07:44] <Emmy B> I recall the fritz campaign in early 2014 on the subject to not question JA in London
3172,[2015-08-18 06:08:17] <Emmy B> She played politics not serving justice.
3173,"[2015-08-18 06:09:37] <Emmy B> If there is evidence of collaboration between Ny and Fritz, we already know Ny contacted Expressen for a PR stand in London, then where are the 4 pillars of democracy in Sweden?"
3174,[2015-08-18 06:09:38] <WISE Up Action> What a hideous PR firm that is - Ny + Fritz. Bet they've never spoken to a working class poor woman in their lives
3175,[2015-08-18 06:10:28] <Emmy B> Are they collaborating in managing a legal outcome? they are supposed to be independent.

3177,[2015-08-18 06:11:43] <Emmy B> Do they wish to by-pass UK libel laws maybe?

3183,[2015-08-18 06:28:38] <WikiLeaks> Look at Borgstrom's bill. He even billed the state for reading NY-JA lawyers correspondence. In other words NY was forwarding the defence correspondence. However the defence never received a single letter of NY-Borgstrom. They were also in lock-step about the decision to interview/not interview.
3184,[2015-08-18 06:30:25] <WikiLeaks> So the toxic Sands has just removed http://sofiawilen.com
3185,"[2015-08-18 06:33:51] <Emmy B> Re Sands, the article I appended here of her conviction proves she is activein other 'causes' in an agressive manner and has convictions. On another topic, Valenti might have scraped her twitter record regarding her Assange tweets"

3194,"[2015-08-18 06:53:12] <WikiLeaks> We have more detail. The article is about 2k words. It is straight prosecution/fritz line.

3200,"[2015-08-18 06:58:49] <WikiLeaks> Yes, we believe Guardian will likely publish via US to avoid libel laws. Public figures are unable to sue for libel unless malice can be proved."
3201,"[2015-08-18 06:59:10] <M> Helen Lewis had a piece a few days ago that had a similar taste - it went off on how the women have been called sluts, liars, etc, which is damaging, but made no comment as to how damaging the label rapist is on someone who has not been convicted. Luckily, it didn't seem to gain much traction and is now stuck behind a paywall."
3202,[2015-08-18 06:59:45] <WikiLeaks> do you have a copy of the Lewis article?
3203,[2015-08-18 07:01:26] <M> I'll have to search for one. Didn't expect it to go under paywall.
3204,"[2015-08-18 07:03:39] <WikiLeaks> One positive is that we hear that there is debate within the Guardian, and there is a significant faction that are very suspicious about the whole case and how they're being instrumentalized."

3236,"[2015-08-18 14:54:11] <WISE Up Action> Thanks, Em - that's useful. Valenti seems to be one of those 'conflaters' amongst other things, which is a particularly sloppy and/or devious way of arguing a point that becomes very difficult to rebut (having to pull the strands apart is long-winded and people lose interest/think it's fussing with detail - which of course 'the devil is in..!'"
3237,[2015-08-18 15:00:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> She may not be worth rebutting. Might be better to ignore and just keep getting the truth out as widely as possible. Let her fall over her own culpability and malevolence.
3238,"[2015-08-18 15:02:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> On the other hand, it might be worth well-publicizing Fritz's 'accuser' attorney money-making scheme. It's a very bizarre thing."
3239,[2015-08-18 15:03:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> Borgstrom has an earned himself an awful reputation; wouldn't be surprised to see Fritz similarly disliked/distrusted.

3245,[2015-08-18 15:33:43] <WikiLeaks> In a press war you should almost always pre-empt.

3255,[2015-08-18 17:01:26] <WISE Up Action> I think she should have had the courage and nouse to write a personal testimony instead of trying to frame it as a book of universals. As a personal perspective it would have credibility; there's a place for writing in an extreme way about situations like that - it has its own emotional truth.

3288,[2015-08-19 07:07:24] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/634001138291994624 JA-haters are rallying the troops
3289,"[2015-08-19 07:16:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Considering how many strong, intelligent, professional women support JA, the whole 'anti-feminist' thing is a complete joke. But rabid feminists of this sort refuse to listen to anything that counters their ideology, even if it comes from other women."
3290,"[2015-08-19 07:17:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> I just got my ticket to the 9/8 Verso Books event! It's a nuisance drive into Brooklyn, ~50 miles that will take closer to 2 hours, but worth it!"
3291,"[2015-08-19 07:46:42] <Emmy B> I don't even see this as a feminist dialectic issue, once a matter completely veers off the most basic of facts then it is only an opportunity to bully and spit on others as a tool of social exclusion."
3292,"[2015-08-19 07:51:53] <Emmy B> When as a child once was asked to offer my chair to my brother as he entered the room so as to sit next to the fire. There was no logic or fact required, reason had nothing to do with it. I had to make space for him and I did. Such articles that I have read JV producing is telling the world there is no space close to the fire for JA, others have to sit there. It is a social exclusion that aims to the physical and intellectual disappearance of the other from a space they wish to dominate."
3293,"[2015-08-19 07:54:22] <Emmy B> It is not about the truth or the facts or the protection of others or philosophising about ethics and morals, it is all about complete exclusion from the social/political space that they themselves wish to not just occupy but dominate."
3294,"[2015-08-19 07:58:49] <Emmy B> Unfortunately the Guardian has proved again and again that as an organisation wishes to dominate that space by the fire, see the contempt they treat Jeremy Corbyn. But JV may not be a suitable banner bearer, I expect her article to be heavily edited as it would not stand to scrutiny. Her only gravitas will be carrying SW voice, a great shame."
3295,"[2015-08-19 08:01:38] <Emmy B> Mrs Fritz cannot have her client's best interest at heart to be arranging such collaboration, literally throwing her name on the ring of public scrutiny when she knows there is nothing to be gained."
3296,"[2015-08-19 08:06:07] <LibertarianLibrarian> That makes a lot of sense, Emmy. It's not about the issue itself but their own power and recognition and the ability to push others down. I've seen that in many other areas too, it's just that I've had personal run-ins with too many feminists like that. But it can happen anywhere insecure people need attention &amp; domination of others to build up their own self-image."
3297,"[2015-08-19 08:06:57] <Emmy B> And there confirms once again the politicisation of the case. I wonder will it be a bit like what MGT attempted to do with the Steinitz journo at the Stern....and having his lawyer giving quotes etc. Let's see because now, with the AA case dropped and SW case remaining maybe it will be easier to sue for defaming and finally through this lawsuit get access to the MSM messages in the case file, so guarded by Ny?"
3298,[2015-08-19 08:07:18] <WISE Up Action> It is the use of tools of social exclusion (oppression) that are perceived to have been (and be being) used against them. What (as Bella puts it) 'old-skool feminism' does is reject those tools altogether.
3299,"<p>Experience shld be heard and has it's own legitimate space, and this is of its essence an emotional space - people's personal narrative is a vital part of the truth. That can be as expressed in as extreme a way as people's emotions are. It's the stuff of poetry, memoir, art etc"
3300,<p>What this stuff does is to place that emotional violence in a journalistic space and ask it to be recognised as objective.
3301,"[2015-08-19 08:07:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> Mrs Fritz has only been out for herself from the start. She's been somewhat in the background compared to Borgstrom, because of his public profile and history, but now she can get the attention regardless of the impact on her 'client'."
3302,"[2015-08-19 08:15:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think it's also a fallacy to say that journalism is 'objective' except in cases where the evidence is clearly and openly provided, as Wikileaks has sought to do by making all documents available. Yet, even the straight out ""x happened"" can be shaded by personal bias. That's a big issue in research and it reminds me of the difference between 'analytic' or 'quantitative' studies vs qualitative studies, where the latter deliberately explore personal experience and narrative. The issue is that even the best 'analytic' research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered."
3303,"<p>I'd rather see journalists who are capable of recognizing and accounting for their personal biases, willing to minimize those by providing documentary evidence, but without the false pretense of objectivity, as it seems that those who cry the loudest about being objective are usually the most biased."
3304,[2015-08-19 08:19:52] <WISE Up Action> OK - objective probably not the right word - I just mean analytical
3305,"[2015-08-19 08:21:05] <Emmy B> We can't escape wishing to control the narrative when we write an opinion paper, this is hardly a dialogue it is an opinion wishing to influence. If we see this as a march, who would be persuaded to follow the ambitious lawyer with the glitchy suit, screaming money and success? The emotionally charged journalist who holds the hand of what she presents to the world to be a child but in fact is a fully grown woman. The story is five years old and the march has taken a different direction long time ago. Of course there are interests to be served that push to influence events politically as this case has been politicised. But the more narrow the spectrum they focus on the more evident these become."
3306,[2015-08-19 08:22:43] <Emmy B> M has shared an interesting tweet so we already know who in twitter will jump into the 'debate' but there is as per usual no real 'debate'. The only objective is knock JA/WL down off that cosy space by the fire.
3307,[2015-08-19 08:24:00] <WISE Up Action> Do we know when the 'opinion piece' is coming out? I can't remember if it's been discussed already.
3308,[2015-08-19 08:25:31] <Emmy B> We don't know. Wait and see.
3309,"[2015-08-19 08:27:00] <WISE Up Action> Obviously, the most interesting thing to anyone who isn't committed to bias already and hasn't made up their mind what they think, will be SW's contribution...and that is pretty much a complete unknown I guess"
3310,[2015-08-19 08:27:48] <Emmy B> It will not be from the horses mouth though.
3311,[2015-08-19 08:28:15] <WISE Up Action> How d'you mean?
3312,"[2015-08-19 08:28:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, it will be interesting to see whether what she says now matches up to those early tweets &amp; texts and how they will attempt to play a change."
3313,"[2015-08-19 08:29:29] <WISE Up Action> You mean her words will be presented to suit the agenda, Em? By Valenti?"
3314,"[2015-08-19 08:30:19] <Emmy B> well, having seen how Valenti misrepresents a JA's views (referring to a video as proof when the video disproves her point) as I mentioned above yesterday, when she refered to JA's interview about Ron /Rand Paul"
3315,"[2015-08-19 08:31:48] <Emmy B> , Having seen again how in one of her posts she hyperlinks to the guardian article as proof of her claim but when you go to the article you do not find that proof but the opposite"
3316,[2015-08-19 08:32:54] <Emmy B> I wonder how much of the SW real views we will get to read for ourselves as a substantial quote or are we just going to be 'served up' a fillet cut and tailored to suit JV's agenda
3317,[2015-08-19 08:33:26] <WISE Up Action> That kind of disingenuous/sloppy linking/conflating is referred to specifically by several reviewers of her books
3318,[2015-08-19 08:34:57] <Emmy B> or maybe it will be a Q&amp;A where easily a journo can lead the interviewee to say the bits they are looking to hear... hmmm if that is her case with her books then quite possibly we may not get to hear SW's voice.
3319,"[2015-08-19 08:34:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> If she continues that kind of sloppy misinformation, it certainly gives open room for factual corrections."
3320,[2015-08-19 08:36:04] <WISE Up Action> Trouble is the detail you have to go into is often in itself a distraction - people lose interest/think you're being picky
3321,"[2015-08-19 08:37:11] <Emmy B> Anyway it could be that it will be the lawyer Fritz transferring SW's voice as in the case of Borgstom telling the journos what AA said, so she could at any time deny it or become hearsay rather than a testament."
3322,[2015-08-19 08:37:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> So you select out a couple of obvious examples and then 'wonder' about the accuracy of the rest of it.
3323,"<p>That could very well be, Emmy."
3324,"[2015-08-19 08:40:14] <Emmy B> How often we have seen amongst trolls that they take a complete sentence, even a true sentence that someone has wrote, and put it into a context that it appears to be a believable lie. At the Fake forum this has been done constantly. A rule of misinformation if you like. It could be SW's quotes are also used in this way, we don't know."
3325,[2015-08-19 08:40:52] <WISE Up Action> Yeh - sometimes works but pretty hard not to lose pple's interest being too complex in a tweet.
3326,"<p>Good point abt hearsay, Em"
3327,[2015-08-19 08:41:09] <WISE Up Action> ie legally
3328,"[2015-08-19 08:42:31] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, taking things out of context is a common ploy. How much of that have we seen already? All we can do is try to point to the true context."
3329,[2015-08-19 08:43:15] <WISE Up Action> And that's my point about complexity - that sort of deviousness quite effective for reasons I just said. Why I often think sticking to the salient and key factual points best strategy
3330,[2015-08-19 08:45:24] <WISE Up Action> If V's piece like Steinitz - who was trying to say JA responsible for/encouraged maligning of women by 'supporters' that's an easy point to refute - why shld he be responsible for that?
3331,"[2015-08-19 08:45:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> True, it is hard to make more complex things clear in tweets or the more simple social media."
3332,"[2015-08-19 08:46:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> Well, we'll have to see what her piece actually contains and then carefully pick targets, if needed."
3333,"[2015-08-19 08:47:24] <Emmy B> I agree! with first point WiseUp and this is all we can do, stick to the facts. Perhaps they will talk about 'a cult' again. Also agree with Jenny. But let's also see how the article will be used in the US, in the UK in Sweden. It will be a starting point for other publications to refer to it and in the process further filter the message to fit the objective. In the UK due to the clear position of the UK government."

She witnessed Sands behaviour and how upset, concerned we felt. At the time Alison Earle had herself observed that such behaviour stood out as fake. I am asking for advise, maybe rather than just writing a blog post on the matter, myself and others who knew her here in London issue together a press statement for publication. If Sands name is mentioned in the JV article. We can distance ourselves and condemn her behaviour, not through twitter tittle tattle but properly in a considered and convincing way, eponymously."

Like recovered memory syndrome too. Should ALWAYS be sus when due process &amp; research standards being undermined. Who can it possibly help??

3375,[2015-08-20 12:57:29] <WISE Up Action> The very particular thing I value about the spirit of Occupy was what it was always criticised for. As in not coming up with a manifesto.
3376,"[2015-08-20 15:29:37] <WikiLeaks> It was criticized for not having a manifesto, because the establishment press wanted something to attack it with its manifesto. It surely would have died even sooner if it had one."

3405,[2015-08-22 06:20:18] <Emmy B> This is what oppositional politics cause: it very own opposition political movement. Eurogroup's victory over Tsipras with his capitulation to its demands has split Syriza and Greece now has a new mainstream political party of the Left clearly open to Grexit. With 20th of Sep the election day we won't have to wait long to see whether the 32 MP rebels will get re-elected and how much support will Tsipras still hold.

3444,"[2015-08-25 06:45:35] <M> Also, bizarre attack on the entirety of the left (incl., of course, JA supporters) by Sarah Ditum, who is no stranger to attacks on JA. https://archive.is/SnvJp#selection-1003.290-1003.379"
3445,[2015-08-25 06:46:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Welcome Greta!
3446,[2015-08-25 06:46:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> That is a really bizarre article by Ditum.
3447,"[2015-08-25 07:40:37] <voidiss> Yes, I agree, Ditum's article is really strange as an attack. It can be also interesting from another point of view, but the low blows against Assange and supporters are always the same and they're put in even when they have nothing to do with the article itself. Also, I think Hyde's ""joke"" is very telling: it isn't a proper criticism so MediaLens can't answer back, but still it pushes a dangerous (and too much rooted) smear. When they don't know how to attack they use the ""conspiracy/paranoia"" card."
3448,[2015-08-25 07:40:49] <voidiss> (Thank you Jenny!)
3449,[2015-08-25 08:00:39] <WikiLeaks> We hear Guardian are very nervous about the JV article. So either its likely to have been massively expanded with a news reporter or its been killed.
3450,"[2015-08-25 08:32:41] <WikiLeaks> Andrew Golis @agolis, is not just JV's husband and not just anti-JA. He was involved in the PBS documentary attack on WL. After airing it, PBS was hacked by anons in response and forced to issue a humiliating press release stating that Tupac was alive and found in New Zealand."
3451,"[2015-08-25 09:56:45] <M> Guardian/Gitmo article avoids citing WL; says ""long-neglected US military capture information"", which links to Miami Herald, instead of to WL directly."
3452,[2015-08-25 09:59:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> All of which is typical of the Guardian.
3453,[2015-08-25 10:03:47] <LibertarianLibrarian> I could see that JV's 'style' of rather unsubtle assaultive writing could make them nervous.

3455,[2015-08-25 10:35:46] <voidiss> Their nervousness for JV's article shows that they know the piece is going to be full of lies/smears and so they feel the pressure of having

3463,[2015-08-25 14:26:54] <WikiLeaks> Well spotted; likely trying to do a deal over the alleged ecuadorian intel docs published in Focus Ecuador
3464,[2015-08-25 14:39:37] <Emmy B> MGT has been having them translated and posted in his site.
3465,"[2015-08-25 14:41:56] <Emmy B> He is a proven prolific liar, manufacturer of lies, anything he propagates I see with the greatest suspicion."
3466,"[2015-08-25 14:52:40] <voidiss> As has been noted, the article on Focus Ecuador was written by Villavicencio, who was convicted of defaming Correa and fled to US. I'm not commenting on his case, I'm just pointing out that US are surely very willing to use him as symbol of 'bad Ecuador's skewed free press right' and that probably, since they're hosting him, he's playing by their side and has interest in writing an article like that. Surely MGT is super happy of it, so he can use it to smear over and over."
3467,"[2015-08-25 14:56:41] <WikiLeaks> MGT is small fry; no-one follows him and almost no-one reads his nonsense on the fake WLF. However, his ""outreach"" activities do need to be watched."
3468,[2015-08-25 15:04:05] <Emmy B> Sadly I do read his nonsense and will be keeping an eye as per usual.
3469,"[2015-08-25 15:05:12] <voidiss> Yes, his site is really absurd and exaggerated, it'd be impossible for people to believe it. But MGT likes to exploit the pointless ""Assange doesn't criticize Ecuador"" card."

3514,"[2015-08-28 02:54:05] <voidiss> I think that being very nationalistic, Le Pen is also one of the strongest opposer of US control over France, so as a result she agrees with offering Assange asylum. But I think it's positive too."

3523,[2015-08-28 10:35:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> That report is yet more support for why JA applied for and was given asylum by Ecuador. Sweden's response even on Snowden made absolutely no sense.
3524,[2015-08-28 12:01:24] <WikiLeaks> if people can tweet the newsweek excerpt (linked perhaps to interior sectiosn via archive.is or with image excerpts in the tweet) to the various diplomatic twitter accounts / diplomats / foreign affairs journalists / academics that'd be very helpful!

3542,[2015-08-28 18:02:30] <WikiLeaks> FYI we have confirmed that James Ball is working on an article re-stating the Focus Ecuador article.
3543,"[2015-08-28 19:31:32] <M> Yes re article (previously mentioned that MGT seemed to be feeding it to people, including Ball)."
3544,"[2015-08-28 19:49:22] <WISE Up Action> God, they are repulsive. Trough, trough, trough."
3545,"[2015-08-28 19:53:07] <noll> well, if you want competence re security - do it yourself, but that's not a choice here. expect Ball et al. will have a field day."
3546,"[2015-08-28 19:54:06] <M> Ball is also at Buzzfeed now, which has even lower editorial standards than the Guardian, if any at all."
3547,[2015-08-28 20:00:04] <WISE Up Action> Yep - and just enough veneer of issue to take it out of pure gossip (which I think they've done to death as far as the public are concerned tbh - there's only so many times you can repeat 'broom cupboard' and all the other pathetic cliches). They should really get a life before they totally disappear up their own arses.

3551,"[2015-08-29 03:49:48] <WISE Up Action> It's not nasty. Starts w him stressing the difference between what he's been told to expect (a raving lunatic) and how he finds JA (perfectly rational). Which he obviously admires under the circumstances. Nonetheless ""interviewing Assange is strange. Damn strange"" I'll bet!! Consider the life-choice disconnect."
3552,"<p>The piece is kind of 'languid', flits about. Probably because he is unfamiliar with/uninterested in the real issues (as in geopolitics/justice/truth etc!)."
3553,"<p>But he doesn't go on about the Swedish case at all; there's much more about the US case, which he seems to take at face-value (despite that quote fr Appleyard). So it's good in that it doesn't belittle the threat to Assange even saying ""he may be right about that"" w ref to JA's conviction that Ny's delaying tactics are to serve the US timescale, enable them to build their case."
3554,"<p>The worst thing is, that, apart from a ref to the ""horrifying footage"" of Collateral Murder, he has no regard for/understanding of the ground-breaking work of WikiLeaks, or JA's role (so, what's new?). It ends with"
3555,"<p>the terrible ""he's a hero to many in the land of protest for protest's sake"" after citing who he's a villain to and why. And it really is like the bloke has landed on an alien planet and is trying to communicate the experience to the normals back home.."
3556,"[2015-08-29 05:36:55] <voidiss> Thank you for the summary! If the article is like that, it's really sad even if it's not a smearing one. It shows one more time that there are too many people who don't understand anything about WikiLeaks work, who think about Assange and other involved in this struggle as guys who fight just because they're a sort of ""we're against everything just to be against"" - which is so damn wrong -, or who don't care about the important revelations at all. And all of this is so disappointing, even if it's expectable, since many many people even refuse to inform themselves of get interested in these issues. And that's why WL is so essential anyway."
3557,[2015-08-29 05:37:00] <voidiss> And regarding Ball's collaboration with MGT... I'm really curious to see if he will actually prove those documents are true.
3558,"[2015-08-29 06:05:00] <noll> highly likely they are genuine. re article, if spin placed over docs discounted, left w/ a completely unremarkable security service assessment detailing concerns any fool could list. the actual issue here is incompetence (every agency's greatest enemy) - we're not going to point out the obvious, or add to information already know."

3579,"[2015-08-29 15:44:50] <M> With The Times publishing stuff more along that line, the sometimes-positivity of today's magazine interview is quite impressive. The ""Count Assange"" article is pure speculation, but the author threw in bits taken from other articles in order to make it sound accurate. I love how the only source is ""a diplomat familiar with the domestic set-up of Mr Assange"". Seeing as they don't even specify WHERE the diplomat is from, my bet is that it was a UK diplomat."
3580,"[2015-08-29 15:53:03] <voidiss> Yes, maybe it was better not to read ""Count Assange"", that's an all-smearing article.

3581,"[2015-08-29 16:53:43] <noll> 'Count Assange' is reads like a UK FO fantasy that busily taps into Maduro's 22% rating as though Correa's 60%+ is not equally deserved, &amp; the ""diplomat familiar w/"" has reseeded ""stories"" that are patent bullshit. it terms of an effective hit piece, it's so amazingly poor, so completely obvious - have to ask, is that deliberate policy?"

3595,"[2015-08-31 06:51:23] <Emmy B> As the political struggle for power intensifies in Ecuador the big money will always find a way to push their message across to get back to power. Let's not beat about the bush, using Assange for internal Ecuadorian politics can please one and only one master, the US and its local puppets."
3596,"[2015-08-31 06:52:45] <voidiss> Thank you, clear now. In"
3597,"[2015-08-31 06:54:30] <voidiss> Thank you, clear now. It's likely you're right... That's absolutely not a good thing when even Ecuador starts using JA in its political games."
3598,[2015-08-31 06:54:54] <Emmy B> The agents of chaos are feasting in any country that lets powerful interests usurp and subvert social movements as a ladder for them to climb the steps of power.
3599,"[2015-08-31 06:58:21] <noll> Greta, it's not Ecu 'using JA' - read the EFF article, it's Ecu censoring of surveillance reporting, which is hardly w/o precedent."
3600,[2015-08-31 06:58:55] <Emmy B> yep 'Ecuador starts using JA' is a simplification. Some power interests within Ecuador may wish to use JA for political games.
3601,"[2015-08-31 07:01:15] <voidiss> I've read it, I'm not referring to the DMCA notice against Focus Ecuador, I'm refferring to your initial point, that probably if Ares Rights have censored the site it's because the documents are genuine. And that means they're spying on him etc, so there may be an interest in using him for ""political games"" or something."
3602,"[2015-08-31 07:03:56] <Emmy B> ...the world over... Greece, Italy, UK etc. of course on this particular occasion we are concerned foremost with JA's safety. Correa's gov has granted asylum."
3603,[2015-08-31 07:05:07] <M> Comments from Swedish Prosecution Authority officer re today's meeting between Ecuador and Sweden http://sputniknews.com/society/20150831/1026390585.html
3604,"[2015-08-31 07:07:40] <voidiss> Exactly. I'm just wondering how sincere the protection Ecuador's offering to Julian is, now that we know they're spying on him. I've always thought Ecuador was a solid, secure ""ally"" for Julian, I wouldn't want to find out this isn't true."
3605,"[2015-08-31 07:09:56] <noll> re 'spying' on JA. no security agency on *Earth is not going to do that - never mind JA, they'll do it to entirety of own staff + all visitors - it's an embassy! &amp; the most spied upon, except perhaps for US in Moscow, Russia in DC."
3606,[2015-08-31 07:14:36] <noll> of some concern is 'management' of JA. &amp; all we can say is Larry David is better experienced on a screen at home.

3608,"[2015-08-31 07:20:39] <voidiss> What do you mean with ""management""?"
3609,"[2015-08-31 07:25:39] <Emmy B> My dear Greta, The Ecuadorian Embassy is responsible for JA's safety, they have to manage, organise the security arrangements for his safety. They also have to organise the management of the Ambassadorial business at the Ecuadorian Embassy. And the safety of the Embassy's staff. It is is for this reason that this space is granted by the Vienna Convention the privileges it has, this space continues and must continue to operate as an Embassy."
3610,"[2015-08-31 07:27:19] <voidiss> Okay, got it. I agree too. Sorry for this mess, I just needed to understand what you meant."
3611,"[2015-08-31 07:35:10] <Emmy B> I understand and it is good we discuss these matters. We all dream and share your wish for his freedom and try each and everyone of us to do something to help his cause, the WL cause. The Ecuadorian Government has to manage the situation the best way they can continuously for the last three years, under very difficult circumstances. The political leadership of Ecuador remains committed to protect his life, his Human Rights. Despite unprecedented pressures from US Ecuador has found it in their bones to stand up for him. Other Latin American countries support Ecuador's decision. Other stronger nations like Italy, France, Germany UK, failed to act, even now after all we have learned from WL and Snowden, they still do not act. The world is revealed to us having a very ugly face. Still, it is Ecuador we have to thank for for every day that it passes."
3612,"[2015-08-31 07:36:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, it's sometimes confusing, esp. when trying to weed out truth from propaganda. I'm not tremendously surprised that Correa has some bad apples around or that his govt, like any other, is engaged in some surveillance activities. It's pervasive. I do suspect, however, that some of the attacks on Correa's govt are due to US attempts to undermine him. But so far, he remains an incredibly popular and successful leader, for good reasons. And his govt seems committed to doing the right the thing by JA."
3613,[2015-08-31 07:38:57] <Emmy B> yep __
3614,"[2015-08-31 08:00:22] <noll> if you think 'let's monitor JA (what could possibly go wrong), &amp;.. we've been hacked by the guys across the street!' is woeful, it as *nothing compared to: https://www.emptywheel.net/2015/08/31/did-china-and-russia-really-need-our-help-targeting-spook-techies/"
3615,[2015-08-31 08:09:56] <M> Pretty decent backlash against ABC's Tom Switzer for saying that WikiLeaks hacks its info on Qanda https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23qanda%20wikileaks&amp;src=typd
3616,"[2015-08-31 10:39:59] <WikiLeaks> Ecuador is a state with good factions and bad. However some of the good things it has done are very good indeed, whereas its abuses are quite average."
3617,[2015-08-31 10:51:41] <WikiLeaks> We suspect JV/Guardian have killed that article but remains a possibility that they're biding their time.
3618,[2015-08-31 10:59:53] <voidiss> It's sad that some people use to blame JA for those average Ecuador's abuses. Really pointless but of course very crafty for who has smearing aims.
3619,[2015-08-31 10:59:56] <voidiss> I hope they have actually killed it.
3620,[2015-08-31 11:02:08] <M> Snowden gets similar attacks re Russia. Greenwald made some good comments on it early on &#8212; as if there's a perfect country on Earth to seek asylum in!
3621,"[2015-08-31 11:09:36] <WikiLeaks> On the quite average: there's no allegation that ecuador has killed a journalist, that any are in prison for journalism, or even, with all the recent protests, that a single person was shot."
3622,"[2015-08-31 11:10:24] <WikiLeaks> Even in relation to Hackingteam, the allegation is that Ecuador had a license to spy on about 16 people concurrently."
3623,"[2015-08-31 11:11:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, exactly. Sadly, throwing dirt at other people is a very common method of trying to turn attention away from your own abuses."
3624,"[2015-08-31 11:12:21] <WikiLeaks> It hasn't invaded anyone, bombed anyone, exported weapons to anyone. It's people are the 3rd happiest in the world, according to Gallap."
3625,[2015-08-31 11:16:16] <WikiLeaks> Its undoubtedly a democracy and its economy has been growing at double the european average for almost a decade.
3626,"[2015-08-31 11:16:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wow, a whole 16 people! How horrible. *sigh* Meanwhile the govts of the people throwing most of accusations are spying on pretty much the whole world, esp my own."
3627,"[2015-08-31 11:19:07] <WikiLeaks> Oil makes up around 15% of the economy, but around 50% of tax revenues so the recent oil collapse has been difficult for the government, which has had to introduce new taxes as a result."
3628,"[2015-08-31 11:20:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> Of course, no one likes new taxes. So you get some protests, esp. when the wealthiest sector is hit in their pockets."
3629,"[2015-08-31 11:20:56] <voidiss> Thanks for all this information. Correa's a representative of a lefties government, so of course it's very convenient for many people - especially US puppets - make Ecuador seem as a soft of oppressive regime, even when it is not, as the information you tell are showing. It has, of course, many difects and ""average abuses"" to fix, but not as bas as some try to say - and especially, not as bad as many other countries that instead are considered ""perfect libertarian democracies"", i.e. US. And obviously Assange is not responsible for politicians' decision when it comes to ""average abuses""."
3630,"[2015-08-31 11:22:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> I don't think anyone in their right mind would think of the US as a 'perfect libertarian democracy', esp. not those of us who actually are libertarians. __"
3631,"[2015-08-31 11:23:55] <voidiss> Oh, well, I'm not referring to informed people! I'm referring also to the image US are trying to show."
3632,"[2015-08-31 11:26:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> I suspect that image is pretty much a total fail at this point. I don't know a single person who is actually happy with our government, even if we totally disagree on what the government should be doing. But the level of disgust with Washington is extraordinary and I get the sense much of the UK feels similarly."
3633,[2015-08-31 11:26:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> The problem is turning that disgust into action.
3634,[2015-08-31 11:26:52] <WikiLeaks> Ecuador has been very good at firing cops. It has fired thousands.
3635,[2015-08-31 11:27:20] <LibertarianLibrarian> Now that's something a lot of nations could learn from Ecuador.
3636,"[2015-08-31 11:29:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> Actually, I think the utter failure of the justice system in the US may - finally - be the thing that sets off real, mass, public response."
3637,"[2015-08-31 11:31:24] <LibertarianLibrarian> Bottom-line, we all know Ecuador isn't perfect, but it has provided some real examples of good, solid leadership and integrity. Goodness knows those are few and far between in today's world, so well worth celebrating, even despite some imperfections."
3638,"[2015-08-31 11:32:11] <Emmy B> I am impressed with the courage and consistency of a small nation finally exercising their sovereignty to improve the welfare of their people, a country that is very poor with a colonial and difficult political past."
3639,"[2015-08-31 11:34:51] <Emmy B> My own country, so much better off, but equally small, is instead pre-occupied in de-frauding the state and when caught read handed pass the buck to infinity and beyond, pretending to be the peacock admiring its own feathers."
3640,"[2015-08-31 11:35:45] <voidiss> @wikileaks, may I suggest you share publicly this information about Ecuador? This would help, so who say ""WL never talks about Ecuador"" should have to shut up, and moreover awareness would increase. But it's just my opinion..."
3641,"[2015-08-31 11:35:50] <voidiss> Anyway, about the US, here in Italy - especially among uninformed and indifferent young people - the feeling of ""trust"" for US seems still pretty high. I mean, many knows about the black stains of that govt, but despite this they still claim and believe US are a true democracy, one of the best compared to many bad evil ugly African/Asian countries. And it's shocking how few actually knows the extent of US surveillance despite the Snowden revelations (almost not covered here apart from some journalists)."
3642,[2015-08-31 11:36:14] <Emmy B> even the first glimpse of hope in last January's election has not survived past 7 months.
3643,"[2015-08-31 11:36:59] <voidiss> And yes, I agree with Emmy, at least Ecuador had courage to stand up and also to improve itself. Instead - despite Troika plans were absurd - also Greece had its faults."
3644,[2015-08-31 11:37:10] <Emmy B> WL is not required to defend Ecuadorian politics Greta.
3645,"[2015-08-31 11:38:48] <voidiss> No, of course not! But I think it would be helpful for WL itself, to stop the old criticism ""not talking about Ecuador""... But maybe you're right, it's not the case."
3646,"[2015-08-31 11:39:27] <LibertarianLibrarian> It might not be bad for 'us' to have some facts on Ecuador saved somewhere, though, when someone throws that kind of stuff at us."
3647,[2015-08-31 11:39:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> I've had it happen.
3648,"[2015-08-31 11:43:26] <Emmy B> Well it is crystal clear from what MGT tweets that this is exactly the objective of the ones who spit out misinformation, to entangle WL into Ecuadorian internal politics to damage Correa and jeopardise JA's asylum."
3649,"[2015-08-31 11:43:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> Greta, there are a lot of great things about the US. Our Consitution and Bill of Rights, no matter how abused in present practice, stands for things I believe deeply in and would/will fight for. Also, in general, the vast majority of people there, as everywhere, are good people who simply want to live in peace. As the saying goes, power corrupts and that's a problem everywhere, but esp. when a govt grows as big as the USG."
3650,[2015-08-31 11:44:57] <Emmy B> See how the misinformation about Snowden's escape twists WL's involvement to stir discord among LatAme countries with JA at epicentre.
3651,"[2015-08-31 11:46:29] <Emmy B> We stick to facts, the truth, supporting WL as each one of us sees fit and able to do so, there is no book with instructions __"
3652,[2015-08-31 11:46:45] <WikiLeaks> Yes. There's mischief there to try and take the heat off US/Europe and make problems for JA in Latam.
3653,"[2015-08-31 11:47:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> So far, the LatAm countries have done a surprisingly good job of avoiding that kind of discord given the amount of pressure on them."
3654,[2015-08-31 11:48:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> But there's no question the pressure is increasing as they continue to try to shore up their independence.
3655,"[2015-08-31 11:49:18] <Emmy B> Good point Jenny, They were not born yesterday, these politicians know how the system works, political naivety is rare among them but the flow of money can create a wave of misinformation."

Of course, the people around him are concerned about his physical and mental health - that's totally normal. He's been imprisoned in a small place for years without access to sunshine and knowing his life is in danger, plus the incredible surveillance and number of police outside.

It's alarming that those war game was done on hypothesis for 2015 - hypothesis that actually are happening now. And I find quite scaring (though really telling) that the only way the Five Eyes are finding to deal with climate change is extending the scope of their control over citizens, exercizing more surveillance, both with the May 2013 ""emergency authority"" and all the different laws to ""outlaw/limit protests"". Instead, on the political side, they are doing pretty well, no important political agreement/solutions have been reached (quite the opposite, the latest Artic drilling issue shows). They think the solution to everything is more control &#8212; or maybe it's convenient for them to think so."

It's incredible that after all the mess in the media and Ecuador's statement in response, she's still talking about 'granting asylum' when instead it is simply 'recognizing asylum': ""MoJ, according to the Constitution, cannot make any promises or enter an Agreement granting any persons asylum status on beforehand"".

3811,[2015-09-03 08:27:31] <Bean> maybe a subtitle would be good too? something like 'sweden stalls while US investigates'?

3815,"[2015-09-03 10:32:59] <voidiss> Absurdist's an euphemism! How can she believe to be credible pushing this already-discredited lie? There was an Ecuador statement in response and she admitted she 'misunderstood EC's request'! And yet here she is, again with 'granting asylum'.

3821,"[2015-09-03 11:16:24] <voidiss> Sorry, M, I remembered the quote wrong, the right one is what you cited. I have interpreted that ""that's how we understood it"" as an admission of misunderstanding, not as a refusal to say they were wrong. Maybe it's just too ambiguous."

4022,"[2015-09-13 11:13:55] <Emmy B> In Greece we all celebrate proudly the day of oxi = no (1940 - WWII). It was not actually said as such but this is how it remains in history... as a 'no you cannot pass your armies into Greece through the Albanian border Mussolini, we shall fight'. Together with the slight distortion of history (the word 'no' never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual 'garment'. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the 'tribal chief' of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the 'greater Macedonia' claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to 'liberate' those historic lands that are currently under foreign control... all this referring to 'the Greater Macedonian Myth' created by Bulgarians in the 40's. Forgive me the rather long dive into Greek history but I think it says a parallel story."
4023,"[2015-09-13 11:20:24] <Emmy B> Whilst in Greece it was the German colonialism that offered the Umbrella for all the land grab, in Syria it is American colonialism."

4027,[2015-09-13 13:12:14] <Emmy B> 'bairns not bombs' &amp; Corbyn's doctrines might finally become the soft language under which a political reality coming home to roost (refugee waves into EU) becomes a foreign policy changer for Syria?
4028,"[2015-09-13 13:24:00] <Emmy B> Today is reported that Merkel said the Greeks should do a better job in guarding the EU's external borders. A little too late, comes the realisation that indeed Greece is a border fortress. But interestingly NATO's Greek military plan, executed at the cost of the Greek tax payer has been mainly deployed for an eminent USSR attack and not by an attack military or otherwise from any other direction. If the poor dingies can cross from Turkey to the Greek islands so easily, imagine how quickly modern military vessels can cross over and of course they trespass daily, who in EU has ever cared? I do hope that Isis does not spread into Turkey (God forbid they feed the monster, can they control it?) or else 'island hopping' the dream of every EU travelling teenager will acquire a very different meaning."

4046,"[2015-09-14 05:34:09] <Emmy B> Reflections on WikiLeaks, Spycatcher and Freedom of the Press"
4047,[2015-09-14 05:35:32] <Emmy B> sorry not video but an audio recording
4048,"[2015-09-14 05:45:27] <Emmy B> there are slight differences between the article and the podcast, the latter being (I think in a language and tone) more supportive of JA"
4049,"[2015-09-14 05:46:20] <Emmy B> I quote "" Sarah Palin, possibly the next US President, called for him to be pursued “with the same urgency we pursue al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders.” No doubt her supporters were able to read what they liked into that remark."
4050,"<p>While Assange is no doubt quite safe from assassination, when an Australian citizen is threatened in this way, an Australian Prime Minister should respond."""
4051,"[2015-09-14 05:47:29] <Emmy B> let's hope MT is a man of his word __ shame the article and podcast is no longer in his website, unless they have been moved in a different URL inside it."
4052,"[2015-09-14 05:59:31] <Emmy B> of course any efforts to potentially assist JA from Oz for MT to keep face could be potentially sabotaged by the High Commissioner Alexander Downer, notorious in my book, let's hope JA's Oz legal representation try their hand directly with the new PM in Oz."
4053,[2015-09-14 06:22:41] <Bean> sorry to disappoint but MT is certainly not a man of his word - he's a multimillionaire career politician - just one example: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/no-internet-filter-says-turnbull/4939156
4054,[2015-09-14 06:24:06] <Bean> he's smarter than abbott which just makes him more dangerous - and possibly electable
4055,"[2015-09-14 06:29:08] <Emmy B> Thanks for the resources Bean __ good to know, I have no particular knowledge of who is who in Australian politics. His expressed views regarding JA/WL as expressed in the podcast lecture to Sydney Uni is widely differentiated than other Australian politicians. In particular I am not aware that anyone has ever given a Uni lecture on the matter so in that respect he may find it hard to publicly retract all 41 minutes of it."
4056,"[2015-09-14 06:30:37] <voidiss> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/jaraparilla/status/643360024597651456 MT's statement is surely rather positive; even if he didn't approve WL's action completely, he seemed to care about protection for JA about assassinations. But... this is what @garymlord thinks about those MT's words:"
4057,"[2015-09-14 06:31:32] <voidiss> Also, given what Bean has just said and comparing it with how Australiam MSM are depicting him, there's a discordance: http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/liberal-leadership-the-malcolm-turnbull-doctrine-telling-the-truth-about-economy-20150914-gjmfyc.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=nc&amp;eid=socialn%3Atwi-13omn1677-edtrl-other%3Annn-17%2F02%2F2014-edtrs_socialshare-all-nnn-nnn-vars-o%26sa%3DD%26usg%3DALhdy28zsr6qiq"
4058,"[2015-09-14 06:32:54] <Emmy B> Having successfully defended the publication of Spycatcher (am I right?) matters of press freedom/freedom of expression and the law have been linked to his professional career (i.e. things he is proud of and added to his professional/political standing) He is not reached the highest office without getting his hands dirty so he will certainly put political expediency above other matters, still threes a wind of change and he may want to play his own tune."
4059,[2015-09-14 06:39:55] <Emmy B> He is hardly condoning of WL anyway only that to me at least it is clear he considers their actions to be journalistic and they should not be prosecuted/persecuted. He also criticises US for doing so.
4060,[2015-09-14 06:45:13] <Bean> would he still do this in power? - i'm sceptical - haven't time to expand or find decent material on him at the moment (sorry!) - but my impression of him over the years is as a very slippery character - a cunning manipulator
4061,"[2015-09-14 06:47:34] <voidiss> I've found another earlier piece in which we talks about WikiLeaks disclosure, immediately after the release of the Cablegate: https://web.archive.org/web/20101210041630/http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/blogs/julian-assange-and-wikileaks/"
4062,"[2015-09-14 08:06:42] <Emmy B> Let's watch what he does then. I don't follow Australian politics other what comes into my timeline, why was Abbot ousted...?"
4063,[2015-09-14 08:24:45] <Bean> so unpopular now he would lose the next election - seen as mismanaging economy (amongst other things) as the australian economy slides due to too many eggs in the chinese resources market basket (try repeating that fast!)...the usual internal factional battles within the liberal party (not that they have 'official' factions like labor)...abbott knifed turnbull in the back to get leadership when in opposition (by one vote in 2009) so payback time... turnbull has had his eye on being pm for years and the time was right to roll abbott - now gives them chance to win next election with a new (old) face - turnbull has credibility in eyes of many liberal Liberal voters... that's my quick and crude analysis!
4064,[2015-09-14 08:26:32] <Emmy B> Thank you!!! __
4065,"[2015-09-14 08:26:54] <noll> it's good news re climate change action :o) ""Turnbull hit the airwaves, declaring he would not back down or resign, and that the Liberal party would be annihilated if it took a ""do nothing"" position on climate change.

MGT is aware of this development. Now awaiting for further legal steps but have no timeline. Please show discretion. There is no need for this information to be the subject of twitter exchanges at this stage. FWLF twitter account was suspended for a period of 10 days due to Chris's complaint for targeted abuse.

4144,[2015-09-18 04:47:27] <Emmy B> apologies for the unpleasantness
4145,[2015-09-18 04:51:44] <Emmy B> for a moment there I thought I read 'cuties' instead of 'culties' then WL could be accused once more of sexism hahahaha
4146,[2015-09-18 04:53:17] <Emmy B> Goodmorning!
4147,"[2015-09-18 05:19:40] <voidiss> Oh LOL, WL! Good morning to you too, ahah!"
4148,"[2015-09-18 05:19:50] <voidiss> That abusive petition is disgusting, Emmy, my god."
4149,"[2015-09-18 05:49:02] <voidiss> There is an ongoing ""game under the covers"" for Sweden to join NATO's task force against Russia &#8212; as always http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=&amp;sl=sv&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.svd.se%2Fhemlig-process-tar-sverige-mot-natos-elitstyrka%2Fom%2Fdet-skarpta-sakerhetslaget&amp;sandbox=1"
4150,[2015-09-18 06:37:57] <Emmy B> __ What is more disgusting Greta is the fact that more than 2500 people signed the petition in support of WL through the Avaaz system but whoever set it up was false and these signatures of support were never registered with the EU parliament. I think twice before I sign any Avaaz petition since. If it used as an instrument of fraud with no accountability on behalf of Avaaz then what sort of political democratic platform is it?
4151,[2015-09-18 06:48:26] <WikiLeaks> We hear from a parliamentarian in Norway that there is last minute tension in the Nobel Peace Prize committee between a Snowden-Assange-Manning triumvirate vs 2nd prize to Obama.
4152,[2015-09-18 06:49:10] <Emmy B> The very best of Luck! <3
4153,"[2015-09-18 06:59:42] <voidiss> Wow! This'd be amazing, good luck! And also it'd be a funny shot agst Obama - think of his shock knowing he has lost the prize b/cos of you!"
4154,"[2015-09-18 07:01:09] <voidiss> Emmy, yes, I understand your point and you're right. It surprises me, I thought Avaaz was a pretty good and reliable org."
4155,[2015-09-18 07:01:12] <voidiss> Sad to know the contrary.
4156,[2015-09-18 07:30:35] <WikiLeaks> Avaaz and all such petition systems are scams.
4157,[2015-09-18 07:30:45] <WikiLeaks> Highly profitable scams.
4158,"[2015-09-18 07:31:34] <WikiLeaks> They place their credit card donation buttons next to the petition. People have the false impression that they are donating to the cause of the petition, but they're just donating to Avaaz et al."
4159,[2015-09-18 07:32:14] <WikiLeaks> They stalk mediagenic issues to pull in people to that killing zone.
4160,"[2015-09-18 07:33:37] <WikiLeaks> We hear that they give/sell their lists to the US democrats. If you look closely at the Avaaz privacy policy, at least as it was a few years ago, you can see that type of thing is not excluded."
4161,"[2015-09-18 07:36:15] <WikiLeaks> They had a 750k strong petition to free JA. We spoke to them at the highest level about the possibility of emailing those people with a WL announcement on some issue (e.g manning trial), which they did not. So they collected a very large list of people that would have been critical to our fight, but only used it for their own purposes."
4162,[2015-09-18 07:37:25] <Emmy B> yes I also send them an e-mail about it but they ignored me.
4163,[2015-09-18 07:38:14] <Emmy B> http://greekemmy.com/2014/03/22/a-curious-matter-with-avaaz-petition-wikileaks-stop-the-crackdown/
4164,[2015-09-18 07:39:21] <Emmy B> Thanks for this insight! I have always wondered about that petition.
4165,[2015-09-18 07:39:40] <Emmy B> But there is something of a worry because....
4166,[2015-09-18 07:40:47] <Emmy B> they are now seen as a platform for progressives in the UK for example to launch political action... give me a minute to find the link so that I explain better....
4167,[2015-09-18 07:42:35] <Emmy B> see here: http://norml-uk.org/2014/02/caroline-lucas-drug-petition-100k-signatures/
4168,"[2015-09-18 07:43:17] <voidiss> Oh. Thank you very much for the info. Great, I add Avaaz to the already-long list of crappy orgs."
4169,"[2015-09-18 07:43:50] <voidiss> If I think it's been one of the first platforms I used to inform myself abt impo issues before knowing WL a few years ago, I want to vomit."
4170,"[2015-09-18 07:44:00] <voidiss> Anyway, I agree with Emmy. Not just in the UK &#8212; also in Italy many people see it as a good platform."
4171,[2015-09-18 07:44:04] <voidiss> And in fact I was advised to read some of their campaigns by a number of teachers here.
4172,[2015-09-18 07:44:18] <Emmy B> http://www.avaaz.org/en/uk_epetition/
4173,[2015-09-18 07:45:00] <Emmy B> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10637699/Drug-laws-may-be-debated-in-Commons-as-petition-passes-100000-threshold.html
4174,[2015-09-18 07:46:51] <Emmy B> Basically Caroline Lucas campaign was joined by Russel Brand's initiative via Avaaz who EMBEDDED the UK parliament petition into their Avaaz Petition and sent it to their 1.1 UK e-mails.
4175,"[2015-09-18 07:47:49] <Emmy B> quote"" Alice Jay, Avaaz campaign director, said: "" This petition shows people want politicians to step up and change Britain's disastrous drug laws."" unquote"
4176,"[2015-09-18 07:50:33] <Emmy B> So, Avaaz 1. Collects donations, 2. Collects our data, 3.'stalk mediagenic issues to pull in people to that killing zone' 4. Sells our data 5. Enters the political arena influencing UK legislative Policy 6. sells itself to politicians as a political player...isn't this the realm of political lobbying or am I wrong?"
4177,[2015-09-18 07:53:40] <Emmy B> The WL example of that petition is very telling as Avaaz on this occasion used WL's reach (the petition was promoted via WL FB page (at the time of 'the Siggi/MGT partnership' to mention a sore point) to get to add into their database.
4178,[2015-09-18 07:56:24] <Emmy B> another lesson learnt
4179,[2015-09-18 08:03:16] <Emmy B> And have they ever made a petition about Manning? I am going to check this...
4180,[2015-09-18 08:03:51] <Emmy B> But I recall they did one for Snowden the one run by David Miranda...hang on...
4181,"[2015-09-18 08:05:05] <Emmy B> yes, here it is: https://sg.news.yahoo.com/brazil-39-snowden-petition-hits-1-mn-signatures-212335747.html"
4182,"[2015-09-18 08:06:02] <Emmy B> I remember because I was asked by an activist friend to translate it to Greek and they forwarded it to their network of contacts in Greece, e-mail lists etc."
4183,[2015-09-18 08:06:30] <Emmy B> How easily are we duped as public?
4184,"[2015-09-18 08:11:25] <voidiss> Yes, they did one about Manning in 2010/11, this link is in Italian: https://secure.avaaz.org/it/bradley_manning/?cl=1014776318&amp;v=8817"
4185,"[2015-09-18 08:12:04] <voidiss> 'Another lesson learnt"": absolutely yes."
4186,[2015-09-18 08:17:13] <Emmy B> So what does the petition say Greta and did they submit it to a public organisation in support of Manning?
4187,"[2015-09-18 08:23:26] <Emmy B> how do you know the date Greta, I don't see it mentioned... curious..."
4188,"[2015-09-18 08:29:54] <Emmy B> it says : 'Sign the petition: our message will be delivered through a poster impact and strong actions in Washington DC as soon as we reach 250,000 signatures.' were there posters put up in Washington? and what strong actions were taken I wonder...."

4190,"[2015-09-18 09:33:19] <voidiss> Sorry, I was out."
4191,"[2015-09-18 09:33:38] <voidiss> Anyway, I've found the same petition link in English here: http://www.avaaz.org/en/bradley_manning/"
4192,"[2015-09-18 09:34:05] <voidiss> I know it is from 2010/2011 b/cos I saw it in that period, I received the email (I followed Avaaz newsletter, as I said)."
4193,"[2015-09-18 09:34:47] <voidiss> After that email I didn't personally see new developments, but it may have been due to my inability to inform myself properly at the time."
4194,[2015-09-18 09:34:59] <voidiss> At the top of that article they claimed Manning was moved to a less strict prison thanks to their petition and the 500.000 signatures.
4195,[2015-09-18 09:35:16] <voidiss> But I've searched a bit online and I have found no links about protests in Washington DC for Manning organized by Avaaz.
4196,"[2015-09-18 09:35:47] <voidiss> Also on Manning support website they recognized the big amount of support the initiative had raised, but said"
4197,[2015-09-18 09:35:47] <Emmy B> thank you Greta!
4198,"[2015-09-18 09:36:02] <voidiss> ""according to the site the petition will be delivered to Washington etc etc"","

4202,"[2015-09-18 09:52:11] <M> On Avaaz, from Jillian C York: ""They are not a 501(c)(3) (non-profit) organization, rather, they are a 501(c)(4), the classification of organization that can lobby, engage in political campaigns, and don’t have to name their major donors.

4203,[2015-09-18 09:54:41] <WikiLeaks> Jesus. And they say WikiLeaks has blood on its hands.
4204,[2015-09-18 10:06:39] <M> But apparently Avaaz lied about their scope of involvement in that! http://www.newrepublic.com/article/world/103330/syria-avaaz-activist-group-journalism
4205,[2015-09-18 10:08:49] <Emmy B> corruption then through and through?
4206,"[2015-09-18 10:55:14] <Emmy B> I thought at the time I had that experience with the JA petition turned tool of abuse, that I could make Avaaz reveal who done it, the e-mail and IP addresses would have been enough but the only thing they did do is to de-publish the petition, then no action, no answers."
4207,"[2015-09-18 11:05:24] <Emmy B> I read in their terms and conditions that I would need a court order or a police order to get them to reveal who manipulated the petition, in the US probably...I thought it would be too complicated and expensive. So after several e-mails and phone calls to their UK media guys I gave up."
4208,"[2015-09-18 11:31:33] <Emmy B> Re Avaaz, here it is said it was created by moveOn that fundraised for Obama: https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/30/3084699_iran-middle-east-no-spring-in-lebanon-.html"
4209,[2015-09-18 11:32:25] <Emmy B> it says it attended The Syrian Opposition Antalya conference
4210,[2015-09-18 11:33:11] <Emmy B> that called for the overthrow of Assad: http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/the-final-declaration-of-the-antalya-opposition-conference/
4211,[2015-09-18 11:35:39] <Emmy B> What is MoveOn https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoveOn.org
4212,"[2015-09-18 11:39:42] <Emmy B> 'In 2007, Moveon was a co-founder of Avaaz, a similar organization with an international focus.'"
4213,"[2015-09-18 11:45:25] <Emmy B> So clearly they have a US political campaigning background and they split their service into three areas, 1. Petition Campaigning of their own volition, 2. Petition services open to all members (I think one has to pay to have their petition circulate within the Avaaz e-mail list) 3. Action on the ground including Extra ordinary activities eg camera's and medical aid to Syrian opposition."
4214,[2015-09-18 11:46:11] <Emmy B> I wonder who was the european partner mentioned in the article.
4215,"[2015-09-18 11:48:18] <Emmy B> Also, now that we know about what GCHQ are up to regarding manipulation of public opinion via the Snowden revelations, one has to wonder how easy it would be to have a pool of a few hundred thousand e-mail addresses handy for influencing on line campaigning."
4216,"[2015-09-18 11:51:20] <Emmy B> I mean...if a mere MGT can create fake members for his forum 24/7 round the clock (maybe using fake e-mail addresses, maybe using special software to manipulate simple machines software set up (who knows?) imagine the opportunities for faking online petitions."
4217,[2015-09-18 12:12:16] <voidiss> Oh-oh. I know which is the European partner: Res Publica https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResPublicahttps://archive.is/z1evm#selection-517.0-517.227https://archive.is/tqLTK#selection-1143.250-1143.672https://archive.is/GSQr9#selection-613.150-613.217http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/alexsingleton/100018739/is-phillip-blond-now-david-camerons-most-influential-thinker/
4218,"[2015-09-18 12:12:20] <voidiss> So apparently Avaaz has its roots both in MoveOn fundraising for Obama, and in ResPublica whose director has ties with Tories. Telling?"
4219,"[2015-09-18 12:12:44] <voidiss> Anyway, completely agree with Emmy about the danger of such a platform."
4220,"[2015-09-18 12:13:15] <voidiss> And they're dangerous because they're not just corrupted and lying, they're even completely incompetent in matter of security/technology and yet they were pretending to be able to offer a good and reliable supply of satellite phones to Syrians etc. Without caring about someone else's life. But well, if they sell lists to US democrats, they're not going to be held accountable for those possible lives losses, of course."

4226,"[2015-09-18 13:08:43] <Emmy B> Greta your articles take me further and further into 'the business of politics' it seems like a parallel political area exists of formulating ideas and delivering them, outside the more traditional democratic institutions who deliver political thinking, platforms and action, ie political parties, occupational unions, associations and professional institutes."
4227,[2015-09-18 13:13:49] <Emmy B> It is a kind of elitist world of political formulation &amp; engagement platforms financed by who is not exactly clear 'I have raised gbp 1.5 mill in two weeks' he says... but seeking to influence traditional institutions of policy making...hmm who would have thought Avaaz was the pseudo grass roots arm of such crypto lobbyist groups.

4229,"[2015-09-18 13:15:26] <voidiss> I agree with you, Emmy. Also, despite the bias in the article, Frontpagemag highlighted that Avaaz founders were connected to Soros' OSF. I'm not so well informed on OSF/Soros, but what I know is that they have a huge influence and they control many things in the world and, as some people like Glenn Beck think, also in politics... so it's not reassuring."

4262,"[2015-09-20 14:03:32] <Emmy B> Evros is natural river and the border with turkey, it has changed shape over the years so border has to be periodically re-agreed which is impossible considering the bad neighbour that Turkey is, in relation to challenging Greek sovereignty, sea air and land, and its invasion/occupation of Cyprus."
4263,"[2015-09-20 14:14:57] <Emmy B> Thraki or Thrace is the name of the Greek prefecture bordering Turkey. It is also home to the only Greek Muslim minority (about 120,000 ethnic Greek, Roma,Turkish, Pomak who are Muslims - the Greek gov does not recognise them as ethnic minorities only as a religious minority). This group of Muslims were excluded from the mutually organised ethnic cleansing of the (odious) 1923 Treaty of Lausanne (exchange population). Just as a note the 120,000 equivalent Greek Orthodox Istanbul minority also excluded by the same treaty is now down to 2,000 souls (eg see 1955 Istanbul progrom). These tit-bits are important."
4264,[2015-09-20 14:17:36] <Emmy B> So the only land border with Turkey (due to the river) is about 10 kilometres and it was fenced off in 2012.

4268,"[2015-09-20 14:30:22] <Emmy B> Some ppl still attempt to cross Evros by boat or swim, and many also die in the process."

Is climate change going to be merely used for further resource grabbing via a 'we must manage resources better' plot of international control? Certainly resources are finite but resourcefulness is not. We have seen medicine/technological advances lead to population explosion but also a widening of the standards of living further. Are we also going to see further restrictions on individual freedom in the name of climate change? it seems in our world every good thing (eg national security is supposedly a good thing) is turned on its head and becomes a nightmare. Upholding Human Rights internationally is a good thing but has been turned on its head to justify illegal invasion, even ethnic cleansing. Let's hope Climate Change agenda stays on track and is not hijacked but the power hungry."

4446,[2015-09-30 17:12:55] <M> I think FUBAR was more what Hillary needed to hear.
4447,[2015-09-30 17:18:07] <WikiLeaks> It's amusing that she'd never heard the phrase before even through the Monica 90s.
4448,[2015-09-30 17:18:31] <WikiLeaks> WikiLeaks took Hillary's FUBAR virginity.
4449,"[2015-09-30 17:29:56] <voidiss> LOL. A well-deserved taking, she will never forget it again."
4450,"[2015-10-01 05:13:58] <LibertarianLibrarian> LOL. Thanks Emmy for the advice. Interesting H emails. It's not like she needs her ego enlarged, but certain types of people like to kowtow to authority to get privileges in return."
4451,[2015-10-01 05:15:19] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not surprising H tried to manipulate the media. Probably works more often than not. Sadly.
4452,[2015-10-01 05:39:33] <Emmy B> Agree Jenny! personally I would love a lady in the top job but HC is a great disappointment. I can hardly assess Democratic domestic policies (other than what NSA has been up to) as I do not follow politics in the US much but US foreign policy has been one and the same like the Republicans so truly abhorrent.
4453,"[2015-10-01 05:54:43] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, we need a high quality female candidate. Voting someone in just b/c of gender would be just as problematic as voting Obama in b/c of his skin color. Obama has been a disaster and I warned my family &amp; friends he would be but everyone felt good about voting for a black President without considering whether he'd be a GOOD President."
4454,"[2015-10-01 05:59:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> These days, there really isn't as much of a difference b/w the Democrats and the Republicans as they and the media would like you to believe. They squabble over things, usually to no useful end, but actually, they pretty much end up doing the same thing. Given the diversity of this country and the corruption in the two parties, any candidate who hopes to win either has to run on nebulous 'change' as Obama did or they wash themselves out to mean nothing and everything. Some day we'll see someone take strong stances and get elected, I hope - I'm suspecting Bernie Sanders could be a contender, much as Ron Paul was. The issue is winning in the end, but the power, media, and money against such candidates is tough to beat."
4455,"[2015-10-01 06:03:04] <LibertarianLibrarian> Much of the problem is the corruption of the mass media. And the reliance of campaigns on how much money they can spend. I, personally, think that there should be limits on how much anyone or any group, whether 'non-profit' or 'profit' can contribute, and limits on how much candidates can spend. Particularly the latter. We should set a definite limit to campaign spending and apply it to all candidates equally. I'm beginning to think we should also ban media organizations from endorsing candidates."
4456,[2015-10-01 06:05:35] <LibertarianLibrarian> The last may not be constitutional but we need some way to curtail corrupt mass media from influencing people's votes. Not sure if there's a way around that one.

4611,"[2015-10-11 10:00:18] <voidiss> I think it was opportunistic too. The other members tried to find a 'balance' with proposing her to ask the firs question etc etc, and if her aim was simply to highlight her point of view of the matter she would have accepted. Instead she went on with the most radical action, resigning, to make the point that ""look at what Assange is doing to our community""."

4620,"[2015-10-11 10:09:19] <Emmy B> Exactly Greta you met her yourself, Queer Strike as a collective as well as PayDay Network with whom they work closely support WL/JA. Charlie Chorley certainly does not represent the Consent Forum attendees and does not speak in their name."
4621,"[2015-10-11 10:13:19] <Emmy B> I shall contact Silky and Didi, in the meanwhile we put facts out there and let them boil in their own juices. I will be very much surprised if Queer strike and PayDay don't issue statements as well as Women Against Rape, their representative came outside the Embassy on 4th of April in support of JA and later during an Edna's Law meeting in Westminster repeated their support I doubt they will walk away now. xxx We keep going __"
4622,"[2015-10-11 10:16:10] <voidiss> Yes, Didi even sent me an email in which she explicitly said ""we work with Payday to support Assange, Chelsea Manning and other whistleblowers"". Clearer than this is impossible! Let's wait for their statement."
4623,[2015-10-11 10:22:23] <Emmy B> We have to let them do their stuff and not interfere in public I will alert them since Ms Chorley is mentioning the Consent Forum in her statement.

4628,"[2015-10-11 10:34:09] <Emmy B> yes that's it Greta! well found. Also see whether there are any more recent affirmations quoted, I know they stand by that original article but let's see if we can find something more recent."
4629,[2015-10-11 10:35:27] <voidiss> I'll search!
4630,"[2015-10-11 10:38:18] <Emmy B> Rix is as usual quick and spot on, always a pleasure to read:-) but a personal attack on Mosley via his fascist ancestor attaching it to the hashtag is not fair and weakens his position in this effort. Corbyn was attacked similarly with the cruelty of his workhouse master ancestor... not fair"
4631,"[2015-10-11 10:40:36] <voidiss> Yes, on that point I disagree, I haven't retweeted his tweets about that. But this article isn't focused on that, and it makes some important points, so maybe it's worth using it anyway..."
4632,"[2015-10-11 10:41:53] <Emmy B> I have shared the article and will do again, I think he got a bit over excited hehehe"
4633,"[2015-10-11 10:43:43] <voidiss> Oh, well, likely. And I can understand him &#8212; all this shit is definitely absurd."
4634,[2015-10-11 10:43:57] <Emmy B> poor Mosley junior really having such an ancestor and if you check his timeline he professes to support Labour although cannot help himself and border the politically incorrect himself...wait for it:
4635,"[2015-10-11 10:44:38] <WikiLeaks> Mosley is much more problematic elsewhere. He worked for the deputy minister of justice 2010-2012, is a tory, pals with mensch, and went to eton."
4636,[2015-10-11 10:45:31] <WikiLeaks> But he's likely anti-feminist.

4638,[2015-10-11 10:48:07] <WikiLeaks> #ThanksSNP is surely satire.
4639,"[2015-10-11 10:51:02] <M> I think it's a riff on the ""Thanks, Obama"" meme. http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/thanks-obama"
4640,"[2015-10-11 10:54:13] <Emmy B> Well being Greek a lot of the Anglosaxon humour is lost to me. But here the object of his satire is a young woman as old as he is with a first class degree and the youngest MP. Yes she is tweeting about pasta. Mosley defines who Black is by her sex 'the woman' is just above 'her indoors' in my book, and her simple tweet. Whilst her predecessor is defined by the status of the office he held 'Secretary of the Treasury'. It is very telling of what he aspires, but what about the reference to racisim? I don't get the joke there at all."
4641,[2015-10-11 10:55:49] <Emmy B> Is it because of her name being Black? no idea

4729,[2015-10-14 06:44:00] <Emmy B> what a maze
4730,[2015-10-14 06:52:17] <Emmy B> I just don't get how equal rights for women need to be so separate from 'equal rights for all' (as often the Proffessor professors). Indeed it is a very recent branch of HR struggles in the context of millennia of Human culture.
4731,"[2015-10-14 06:56:46] <Emmy B> I applaud this struggle as enriching of our society in general liberating the individual in a social and personal context. But I don't understand such isolanist and naval looking ideas as that article describes. It speaks a kind of psychotic language? Why waste one's energy in this way instead of let's say address the many real problems women face around the world still: slavery, mutilation, forced marriages and violence within the context always of HR for all."

4733,"[2015-10-14 07:07:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> I agree with you Emmy, in the end it must always be framed as equal rights for all.

4737,"[2015-10-14 08:55:30] <Emmy B> Jenny wonderful you helped him with his english! I thought it was well written <3 Greek society was very much in flux as I was growing up there, huge differences in attitudes btw city and country for example and from social group to social group. In general women had it tough in a patriarchal society (not to ignore that patriarchy limits mens freedom too not just women's) but my generation had many more opportunities that ever before which went hand in hand with political developments for the better across society. One here in the UK would laugh to read that some occupational insurance funds in Greece would pay out pensions to unmarried women if their father passed away for example but this was a recognition that 'in those days' women could not be financially independent through outside paid work. Other provisions like first born boys of a widow or divorced woman would get reduced time in National Service as they were considered head of the family, i.e. financially providing for their mothers and other dependent members... I mean where do you put such arrangements in the grand literature of feminism? Do we have to permeate every aspect of our social being with ideology? Can't we just 'be'?"
4738,"[2015-10-14 09:34:12] <voidiss> It's saddening, deeply saddening. Once innovative and strong movements such as feminism are turning into a doctrine. Feminism started long ago and it was a wave of change... I remember the suffragettes in '900, for example; Alice Paul and women's right to vote in America. They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now... now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group's human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is 'conquering the term'; I mean, real feminism isn't that ""trigger warning""/""rape culture"" crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course &#8212; as every other conservative/reactionary ideology &#8212; has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women's rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don't do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you're indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don't want to be left out."
4739,"[2015-10-14 09:34:20] <voidiss> And this hyper-sensitivity in colleges, this ""microaggression"" thing, is slowly building up an environment which should stay in a dystopian book, not in our reality. An environment in which everyone must be always kind to everyone, in which everyone must only express accepted views in a group think system and leave out dissenting/radical opinion. And again, all this just helps to value more well-being instead of free speech - expressed with other words, but it's the same old contrast of security vs freedom so loved by NSA and every govt. Another symptom of this widespread culture which molds people into living and dissolving into their restricted area of comfort, without daring to go out of it, challenge the order. Family, job, money. If they have this, they are happy and all the rest can die in front of their eyes and they won't see. And hypocritically they keep saying ""ah, this world is shit, I'd like to see it change"" but then they do nothing to actually change it. ""I would but I can't""."
4740,[2015-10-14 10:39:12] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/CancilleriaEc/status/654349836100177921 Patino press conference on JA in three hours (9:30pm BST)
4741,"[2015-10-14 10:59:49] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, I can remember in college arguing with 'feminists' that I had an equal right to choose between a career or staying home and raising kidd and being told I didn't, that if I chose the latter, I was participating in the patriarchal system, etc. If you don't accept and parrot their exact ideology, you're labeled as 'antifeminist' which is an insult without real meaning but gets easily thrown at anyone they don't like. As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid. It also tends towards defining another group as evil by nature not by action, i.e., if you're male you are automatically bad. This happens often and is why I've always hated to identify myself as anything other than an individualist and a humanist. I've been supporting Black Lives Matter because the situation is so bad right now, but really, for me, it's about equal treatment before the law for all.

4767,"[2015-10-15 08:31:23] <voidiss> What the hell. Another Ball's article, again apparently based on internal Ecuadorian documents: http://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/revealed-ecuador-thwarted-deal-between-julian-assange-and-sw#.rdaMyvEQO"
4768,"[2015-10-15 08:41:05] <Emmy B> I see Ball testifying in a court of law one day over his personal role in persecuting JA. Still, all this could actually work in WL's favour."
4769,"[2015-10-15 08:42:33] <Emmy B> For example, @ Hazelpress might find opportunity for a FOI in Sweden based on the leaked document as well as to quiz for the Expressen journo?"
4770,[2015-10-15 08:46:19] <Emmy B> Not to mention this gives the perfect opportunity to Correa to 'clear out' internal opposition to protecting JA. The anonymous correspondent for example will be known to the gov. The Ball protects his identity could indicate he is aligned to interests represented by Ball within the Ec. gov?
4771,"[2015-10-15 08:47:59] <Emmy B> Anyway, every pitfall offers an opportunity and James Ball article reveals more about those interests, and the fact he represents rather than JA."
4772,"[2015-10-15 09:02:11] <voidiss> How can we know that Correa would 'clear out' those who said that? How can we know that this isn't Correa's thought too? Ball's article has been done for smearing purpose, yes, it's very clear, but if those statements are true, how can we know that this isn't the secret line of the whole Ecuadorian govt? I know that this is precisely Ball's aim, but if (and only if, since I wouldn't bet, given that we're talking about Ball) those documents are true, how can the Ecuadorian govt be trusted anymore? I mean, that Alexis Mera is the legal secretary. I don't know, I'm quite scared and I don't know what to think. I mean, we have always known that Ecuador doesn't agree with WikiLeaks but simply grants JA asylum because of the threats to his human rights, but I would have never imagined they could say something like: ""If he fights with us, we will fire him off to jail in Sweden."" But maybe it's simply Ball who has built up everything just to spread mistrust."

4775,[2015-10-15 09:03:38] <Emmy B> Ball's article will be more helpful than he thinks __
4776,"[2015-10-15 09:04:21] <Emmy B> If I am very mistaken, it will prompt Marianne Ny to make another statement. The more she talks the better __"
4777,[2015-10-15 09:05:18] <Emmy B> It is also embarassing to the Swedish Justice ministry. None of these details are new.
4778,[2015-10-15 09:05:53] <Emmy B> But Sweden now knows that its correspondence is also beein leaked. This is a good thing.
4779,"[2015-10-15 09:07:43] <Emmy B> The question to ask Ball if you want is, whether he has cross checked with the Swedish Prosecution or Swedish Ministry that the Swedish docs are genuine. Or whether he has contacted them for a comment."
4780,"[2015-10-15 09:10:36] <Emmy B> As I read he has not. Why not. Also, has he contacted the UK correspondent of the Swedes again for verification."
4781,[2015-10-15 09:12:21] <Emmy B> The document's dates corroborates what I read at the time that Sweden acted in a sloppy and political manner uninterested in real progress.
4782,"[2015-10-15 09:18:43] <voidiss> Yes, worth asking him these things, you're right &#8212; and if he hasn't contacted anyone from Sweden, how he has verified that the documents are true, if he has. Also, it's worth noting that he always puts only the beginning of the ""leaked docs"" in the article, for example just a little bit of the Ny email. Why doesn't he put it in complete form? Is there something in the rest of email that doesn't play his game?"
4783,"[2015-10-15 09:24:30] <Emmy B> I bet you this article has Marianne Ny sweating, what other of her correspondence will become public?"
4784,"[2015-10-15 09:28:00] <Emmy B> I love how he included in the screenshot the Swedish Ministry's correspondence reference number, so helpful for any FOI __ and the date, the date!!!! five weeks before the statue of limitation been reached. Not very efficient, are they?"
4785,"[2015-10-15 09:29:46] <Emmy B> Plus, a FOI can ask for the serial documents before and after to see any relating correspondence with other departments before or after this particular one."
4786,[2015-10-15 09:32:41] <Emmy B> extremely interesting how the Ny e-mail has the middle name in CC blanked out but let the other two Ingrid and Karin visible. Hmmm something comes to mind... let me check...

4798,"[2015-10-15 10:12:57] <voidiss> These come from a FOIA, anyone can obtain them, so I don't know, probably he simply used them to corroborate and put more 'substance' in its article. He uses only a selected part of them, only the Swedish Ministry statement, without including Ecuador's response or further correspondence, so probably he just needed that bit to play his game, his ""Ecuador stalled the proceedings"" line."

4900,[2015-10-20 00:03:17] <Emmy B> Do you know? I have this creeping suspicion that Paul Close might have been issuing talking points to media via let's say legal bloggers and ex gov lawyers to 'make sense of it all'.
4901,[2015-10-20 00:04:32] <Emmy B> reading his e-mails DAG's blog posts come out screaming...
4902,[2015-10-20 00:04:44] <Emmy B> how is one to know?
4903,[2015-10-20 00:05:50] <Emmy B> Would he have discussed media strategy with Ny? She has certainly answered DAG's questions this summer which was curious.
4904,[2015-10-20 00:06:41] <Emmy B> Would he have hired a PR co to push out talking points onto the press?
4905,"[2015-10-20 00:39:21] <noll> agree re DAG &amp; PC, “zombie facts” published 3 Sep 2012, but they &amp; other interested parties are likely within 3 degrees (or something similar) of each other. speaking of networks - JA isn't first person to be ""in shock"" w/ PC's legal antics: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1304214/Doctor-avoids-criminal-charges-despite-guilty-professional-misconduct-deaths-patients.html"
4906,[2015-10-20 01:50:58] <Emmy B> At which stage did Ny decide to issue a EAW? this would be the only way to get the case conveniently into the hands of the Crown Prosecution Service. If Ny had sought MLA to which government department would she have applied here in the UK or even talked to? a FOI could be sent there as well as Sweden in case any correspondence shows whose decision was to have an EAW issued. When did Paul Close offer his advise to not interview? after the EAW was issued or before? Was CPS the body that advised Sweden on issuing an international arrest warrant and getting the content right to suit extradition process requirements to ensure a successful outcome?

4911,"[2015-10-20 03:44:41] <Emmy B> I would like to ask, is the identity of the people behind wikiwatch known? in particular the so called 'objectivisor' 'objectiviser' persona? I looked up the electoral registry for 'Alan Taylor' as the address came up on whois of the site as early as 2012, it does show a family of four, the Taylors, living in a 2 bed flat over the course of several years but I am half decided to turn up on the door step and check it out for myself as there is mischief there. No doubt in my mind that currently MGT is handling the twitter account 'Alan Taylor'. I am asking all this because for some time I have been suspecting DAG or ppl associated with him involved there."
4912,[2015-10-20 03:46:04] <WikiLeaks> They are both basement dwelling troll types.
4913,"[2015-10-20 03:46:45] <WikiLeaks> Taylor has been producing fake anti-wikileaks ""leaks"" and other propaganda since at least 2009."

4917,"[2015-10-20 03:49:44] <WikiLeaks> His motivation is likely a result of his background and because he ran/runs something called ""PGP board"" and extremely useless WikiLeaks wannabe."
4918,"[2015-10-20 03:51:23] <Emmy B> yes, this is what he has told the world about himself but I think this may not quite be a real person. Maybe it is a 'prop' a persona. We shall see in the course of the years to come."
4919,"[2015-10-20 03:51:56] <WikiLeaks> WL was a threat to both the status mechanisms in his life, and then, there were plenty of our supporters around to ""feed the troll"" permitting this basement dweller to feel alive in the world."
4920,"[2015-10-20 03:52:26] <WikiLeaks> Yes, it's always possible it is just a prop."
4921,[2015-10-20 03:52:35] <Emmy B> Have you never wondered though that he has never shown his face in the real world?
4922,[2015-10-20 03:52:52] <WikiLeaks> And that 'PGP board' was a lame idea of the UK intelligence services.
4923,[2015-10-20 03:54:41] <WikiLeaks> Troll types are sociopaths so they have a paranoic criminal mentality and expect their victims to take revenge one day so are not keen on being identified.
4924,"[2015-10-20 03:58:11] <Emmy B> I have archived all wikiwatch and amIObjective URLs on archive.is as well as saved every article as a webpage, Also archived the wikiwatch twitter timeline and some of the objectiviser tweets. Also that persona's Reddit Q&amp;A and some of the commentary in public on line blogs and newspapers. For a period of six months it was someone's full time job."
4925,[2015-10-20 03:59:37] <WikiLeaks> Yes. It could have been. Or it could have been someone on a mental or medical pension for six months.

4927,[2015-10-20 04:00:51] <WikiLeaks> We had an idea of making a group for all of them.

4930,"[2015-10-20 04:07:49] <Emmy B> I am keeping a close eye because they did a lot of damage at the time and helped solidify prejudices and myths, pushing DAG's articles in every possible social media platform."

4934,[2015-10-20 04:19:14] <WikiLeaks> It is all rather grotesque and does not leave one with a pleasent view of a lot of human nature.

4936,"[2015-10-20 04:29:38] <voidiss> Agree with all this. For example, when those people - and WLF guys are expert in this - make jokes on JA situation and suffering one has a really low view of human nature."

4941,[2015-10-20 13:00:37] <WikiLeaks> What this really is - a Swedish government marketing/co-opertion exercise.
4942,"[2015-10-20 13:01:16] <WikiLeaks> Swedish embassies around the world ""nominate"" people they think should go. There's a bias for markets/allies Sweden is trying to break into/make."
4943,[2015-10-20 13:01:42] <WikiLeaks> The thing is funded and run by @SIDA and the ministry of foreign affairs.
4944,[2015-10-20 13:02:58] <Emmy B> ok __
4945,"[2015-10-20 13:03:19] <WikiLeaks> @SIDA Is Sweden's soft-power-bribery agency. It works the same as USAID, buying off different groups with funding."
4946,[2015-10-20 13:03:55] <WikiLeaks> It's had a lot of influence in the UN and with civil society that way.
4947,"[2015-10-20 13:04:43] <WikiLeaks> A few years ago, SIDA's constitution was changed so it could be used to help prop up Sweden's wars."
4948,[2015-10-20 13:05:01] <WikiLeaks> i.e by funding war lords around Sweden's base in Afghanistan.
4949,[2015-10-20 13:05:50] <WikiLeaks> There's a scene in Mediastan where we interview a Sida person at an Afghan base. Some of oyu may remember it. The woman is lost for words as she's forced to confront what she's really doing.
4950,"[2015-10-20 13:06:14] <WikiLeaks> Anyway, SIF market's itself as a ""freedom"" forum."
4951,"[2015-10-20 13:06:46] <WikiLeaks> But it has always refused JA, WL and Snowden."

4953,[2015-10-20 13:06:59] <WikiLeaks> @ioerror used to attend until they worked out that he was sort of WL.
4954,[2015-10-20 13:07:12] <WikiLeaks> When he confronted Carl Bildt about JA.
4955,[2015-10-20 13:07:16] <WikiLeaks> Then never permitted back.
4956,[2015-10-20 13:07:45] <WikiLeaks> We got hold of a blacklist leak in 2014 that had snowden etc on it in an internal email.

4958,"[2015-10-20 13:08:36] <WikiLeaks> There was a protest there in 2014 among the attendees about the refusal to take WL or Snowden, given that spying etc was the topic and the topic all the time is ""internet freedom""."
4959,"[2015-10-20 13:08:51] <WikiLeaks> This year, with Bildt gone people thought it might improve."
4960,"[2015-10-20 13:10:18] <WikiLeaks> The Topic this year, following, we assume Sweden's ""feminist foreign policy"" (although the new FM isn't too bad, actually in other respects, except russia), the topic is ""gender online"" in particular ""cyber violence""."
4961,"[2015-10-20 13:11:57] <WikiLeaks> But if you can make life difficult for them, by educating the attendees who hang out on #SIF15 it will help to continue to drive home the message that Sweden's anti-WL, anti-Snowden hypocracy has reputation costs and PR manoevers like #SIF15 won't escape these costs."

4964,[2015-10-20 13:14:07] <WikiLeaks> It will show that WL has exposed SIDA (we did in other respects in the cables too) and that the conflict is institutional also and not just about JA.
4965,"[2015-10-20 13:26:26] <voidiss> Oh, how *strange* they're pushing Cyber Violence as theme this year! If SIDA has had influence and connection with the UN, that VAWG can be easily explained. The two initiatives are connected, maybe."

4967,[2015-10-20 13:32:03] <WikiLeaks> UNWomen is almost certainly part funded by SIDA.

4969,[2015-10-20 13:39:34] <Emmy B> The word SIDA is not mentioned in the video but the business credit card clearly shows the interviewee works for them. The section of the video is 31:20 onwards for Northern Afghanistan and starts immediately at the Swedish base in Afghanistan.

5179,"[2015-10-29 03:30:25] <Emmy B> During the junta years 1969-1974 in Greece most newspapers continued their operation, self censoring. It was a most brutal dictatorship, thousands tortured as a control, punitive and reformative process, still Greek society continued to function and newspapers continued to operate. Yes there were individual cases of resistance and some efforts for organised revolt in a small scale but nothing in a grand scale. Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy. They were dismayed at the junta's treasonous effort to overthrow unsuccessfully the democratic government of Cyprus, handing Turkey the premeditated 'way in' to invade and partition the island. Having committed in effect National Treason of the greatest degree in opening the door to the brutal enemy's worst plans, some generals and right wing politicians came to an accord, to bring back Karamanlis, restore democracy in return for impunity for the treason, and impunity for most of the junta's crimes. I bring this as an example to illustrate the sad fact that Democracy and what it means to our society is only as precious as we give it and the value of its currency is only determined by the action we are prepared to take to keep it safe."

5314,"[2015-11-04 06:38:42] <Emmy B> I sent Jon Austin an e-mail informing him the Christine Ann Sands site is fake and other information about her operation and conviction. I am hoping he will take the info down or he might just put the comments I made into his article and make things even worse. Who knows, there is a risk. keeping my fingers cross."

5321,"[2015-11-04 07:29:39] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/659761929087533056 It's not just Sands mentioning Ec Embassy re MMM, though. Major anon accounts are as well."
5322,[2015-11-04 07:45:43] <noll> we're going to do quick storify this evening re Ann Linde's impartiality/ political ties to JA case.
5323,"[2015-11-04 08:09:46] <LibertarianLibrarian> I know I'm behind as usual but... Greta, any US legislation must pass both Senate &amp; House &amp; then be signed by the President. It can get held up at any stage. We can only hope it gets stuck in the Senate."
5324,"[2015-11-04 08:12:09] <WikiLeaks> Sands is a problem, but don't disconnect anon and WL."
5325,"[2015-11-04 08:12:24] <Emmy B> @ M interesting how MSM only mention Sands though, next minute they will be pointing to her sofiawilen website... nice! - not and then hey presto SW's interview on how she is abused by WLsup, Christine Ann Sands already published by UK MSM as a typical WL supporter will do JA no favours. and of course she now has a conviction on a very juicy cause https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8ip1Up2taQ"
5326,"[2015-11-04 08:12:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> There's also a likelihood of significant bias in that poll. Without seeing the methodology, we don't know. But if true, it's a sad thing that the UK people are buying into the propoganda."
5327,[2015-11-04 08:13:22] <Emmy B> Anon have already warned about her in a video
5328,"[2015-11-04 08:13:42] <WikiLeaks> It's beneficial if it is perceived that anon is protesting aout JA and also, internally within anons who may become sources one day."
5329,"[2015-11-04 08:14:22] <LibertarianLibrarian> Unfortunately, the raving lunatics are often preferred by the MSM. More dramatic than rational debate."
5330,"[2015-11-04 08:16:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Anon support for WL is valuable. A good thing however Sands and her ilk might want to twist it."
5331,[2015-11-04 08:16:14] <Emmy B> But Sands has nothing to do with Anon from what I have seen and experience. She damages anything she touches.
5332,[2015-11-04 08:16:21] <voidiss> So we simply need to push the fact that anons themselves took distance from Sands and inform that she isn't representative either of Anonymous movement or WL.
5333,"[2015-11-04 08:16:48] <voidiss> (Btw, thanks for the clarification, Jenny!)"
5334,[2015-11-04 08:18:53] <WikiLeaks> At this moment all that will do is push anons away from WL.
5335,"[2015-11-04 08:19:02] <WISE Up Action> Ffs. What a crock of shit. A veritable cocktail (ha ha) of the Met being utterly disingenuous; srsly taking the piss, the pernicious Public Order Act, the media charlatans, and Sands stirring it wherever she can."
5336,"[2015-11-04 08:19:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Greta. As Emmy's done, we remind people that Sands isn't representative of WL or WLsup while letting Anon do its own thing. Anon is by nature amorphous but the general support in that 'community' for JA and WL is positive."
5337,[2015-11-04 08:19:25] <WikiLeaks> Since it is suggesting that the support for JA is fake.
5338,[2015-11-04 08:21:48] <LibertarianLibrarian> It's a fine line to tread but we simply have to correct inaccuracies with people who may listen and otherwise treat her as any other troll.
5339,"[2015-11-04 08:24:27] <Emmy B> I am out. Jon Austin has just replied that he has amended the article, in fact he has added to the misinformation and even added 'However, a source close to WikiLeaks said it was a fake website and not connected to Anonymous or WikiLeaks and Mr Assange.' I have replied that this misrepresents me and he should removed it."

5341,"[2015-11-04 08:25:18] <M> Media may have picked up Sands' stuff because of laziness. Since she does have the MMM website, media could've assumed it was the official/main site for the protest. It's easier to do that than try and understand the complexities of anon."
5342,"[2015-11-04 08:27:11] <LibertarianLibrarian> What a nuisance, Emmy. Sorry. Have a good afternoon."

5457,[2015-11-06 11:20:21] <Emmy B> The killing of Saunders was what clinched their end as the Greek government decided to bring in the British to help with the investigation. The rest is history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Organization_17_November

Although not generally accepted as 'the truth' about them, the single most damning factor was the fact they were operating for decades without been caught and punished."
5465,[2015-11-06 13:29:25] <Emmy B> Anyone who knows anything about Greece knows about the general incompetence including anyone who wishes to organise crime.
5466,[2015-11-06 13:32:32] <Emmy B> If 17th of November participated in a greater political game outside what it self professed it would be hard to know but the fact they kept at it for so long unpunished leaves many question marks.

5483,"[2015-11-07 05:56:40] <noll> Em, you're repeating a bit. we'd put it something like: New evidence now come to light by Italian Newspaper L’Espresso via Freedom of Information Request directly with the Swedish Ministry of Justice regarding the questioning of Julian Assange. In their issue of October 19th journalist Stefania Maurizi discovered that: “in January 2011, not even two months after Julian Assange had been arrested in London, a lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, Mr. Paul Close, strongly advised the Swedish magistrates against questioning the WikiLeaks’ founder in London. According to Close, the appropriate strategy was to interview him ""only on his surrender to Sweden and in accordance with Swedish law""."""
5484,[2015-11-07 06:01:33] <Emmy B> how about the bit in bold?

5541,"[2015-11-08 08:43:22] <voidiss> That camp was a form of civil disobedience, of course, and the activists even documented many abuses of migrants' hr by"

5545,[2015-11-08 09:01:11] <WikiLeaks> Only way to deal with this is to make JA's case a famous example of false rape
5546,"[2015-11-08 09:02:07] <WikiLeaks> i.e rather than JA is innocent, JA is the most famous case of false accusation. It's a good candidate because the accusation is by the state not the woman"

I live outside London and study PT so I feel a bit out of the loop in many ways. Last week I had my undergrad graduation ceremony at Birkbeck during which the president, Joan Bakewell, lambasted Cardiff's attempts to stop Germaine Greer speaking - JBs view was that freedom of speech and the ability to debate should always prevail at an educational establishment - a view most would share? At the same time UCLU have got into a mess re Macer Gifford. It's delicate because Gifford's supporters are insinuating at some sort of 'Islamist' bias against them in the union and mentioning orgs like Cage negatively and Cage's is a counter narrative that I have supported. The Cambridge thing is a total joke! But one thing I have noticed re UCL and which may apply elsewhere is simply that some of these individuals in the union have disproportionate influence and yet are quite naive / inexperienced / uninformed to say the least. It leads to problems like we are seeing."

5797,[2015-11-14 00:24:06] <voidiss> Who benefits is always the same. It's fucking sickening. Always the same false rhetoric when there are terrorist attacks.
5798,"[2015-11-14 00:24:33] <voidiss> Let's remember that after 9/11 Bush said ""through my tears I see an opportunity"". Of course it is an opportunity for those in power."

5800,"[2015-11-14 00:25:12] <voidiss> will be accepted and justified. But I don't need to say it, it's well-known."
5801,"[2015-11-14 00:28:59] <voidiss> In fact, as this article says https://newmatilda.com/2015/11/14/paris-attacks-highlight-western-vulnerability-and-our-selective-grief-and-outrage/"
5802,"[2015-11-14 00:32:29] <Emmy B> Have you heard Obama's statement mentioning equality brotherhood freedom in French? How bizarre that he forgets these values were established through, actually, a revolution fraught with violence in overthrowing the previous regime. How Holywoodian of the US President.... Let's strip reality of the uncomfortable bits and pick the sanitised slogan re-package it and use it as a media tool in the destruction of the very ideals it stands for. Exceptionalism might work for a US audience will it work for a French?"
5803,[2015-11-14 00:39:19] <Emmy B> Interesting how Cameron's final remarks resonate with me how he justifies UK's collaboration with Saudi Arabia on the basis of intelligence and security information 'that keeps us safe'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMh7RG6_Tp4
5804,[2015-11-14 00:55:22] <Emmy B> Is US/UK collaboration with SA to 'keep us safe' at the expense of its other allies? In the case of Greece US/UK always favoured Turkey in its aggression and was used to further UK/US interests. There is some mutual benefit there surpassing all common sense almost... why not same happens elsewhere.
5805,[2015-11-14 00:58:16] <Emmy B> WL/Snowden revelations show Greece's 2004 US surveillance scandal was not unique in fact it was (we now know) typical of the 5 eyes spying regime on all including Germany/France/Japan etc.
5806,"[2015-11-14 01:00:58] <Emmy B> US/UK over the years has shown 0 policy considerations for Greece/Cyprus on important matters of sovereignty and human rights, international law and favoured Turkish interests instead as it served their interests too."
5807,"[2015-11-14 01:03:59] <Emmy B> We could then perhaps say that Greece/Cyprus is not unique in this respect (although due to size maybe disproportionally exposed to external interference) and that US/UK will favour eg Saudi Arabia grand plans (has any academic written about why SA finances terrorists?, what is its ambitions?) at the expense of its other allies, eg France?"
5808,[2015-11-14 01:05:39] <Emmy B> It is curious to me that from my perspective 'The West' positions itself against theocratic regimes Iran/Saudi Arabia vilifying one and supporting another.
5809,"[2015-11-14 01:07:51] <Emmy B> a big parenthesis here (My mum says Shia Islam is actually 'the protestants of Islam' whilst Sunni 'the Catholics', how is it we align with the hard core party?)"

5938,"[2015-11-16 02:48:28] <Emmy B> Official Greek position regarding Paris aftermath: 1. Greece will not participate in any military operation in Syria as part of NATO, its role in the crisis is to remain a stable partner. 2. Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army's role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can't see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters. In Turkish waters are invisible and suddenly in Greek waters are visible?"
5939,"[2015-11-16 02:56:57] <Emmy B> Greek Navy is not involved in the operations currently but Turks will bring them in (remember they do what they like their navy already trespasses frequently and forces the Greek navy and airforce to be shadowing them around). If Turkish navy get's an in then Greek Navy is forced to participate, then the scene is set for skirmishes and red alert tensions on a daily bases btw Turkish/Greek vessels. If anyone thinks all this has anything to do with saving refugees they can think again, consider what we are dealing with: 1. desperate people 2. ruthless traffickers 3. flimsy dingies. Why, if military vessel as much as approach one of these dinghies the waves they makes might just topple the dingy, not to mention that Traffickers advise refugees that the moment they see the coast guard to sink the dingy so then coast guard is forced to launch a saving operation rather than toe them back to the sea border and co-ordinate with Turkish coast guard to pick them up (this used to happen a lot where some small vessels were forced to return to Turkey) With the weather deteriorating from week to week the death toll increases, the journey is even more perilous."

It refers heavily on earlier WikiLeaks release on TiSA via local Partner Kathimerini to highlight that current EU policy via Merkel and Junker (pressurising Greece to accept Turkish involvement in 'guarding' Greek sea borders regarding the influx of immigrants/refugees) reflects commitments that EU has already made to Turkey via TiSA reminding that Turkey was responsible for formulating the TiSA naval/sea chapter and as a result it formulated it in a manner to protect and enhance its own interests to the detriment of the Greek interests and sovereignty.

6005,[2015-11-19 12:06:40] <voidiss> The bill to add screening measures to refugees in US has passed the House: http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/19/paris-attacks-police-investigate-isis-mastermind-dead-st-denis-raid-live#block-564e2132e4b06e1ab44e1891
6006,[2015-11-19 13:26:25] <Emmy B> Please allow me a little rant regarding the fear of terror and how governments are using this to limit freedoms. This is entirely avoidable and I bring once more the example of my little modest very insignificant country....
6007,"[2015-11-19 13:37:15] <Emmy B> Several times whilst I lived there I and the rest of society experienced intense fear about an imminent invasion (M/V Piri Reis ""was sent in 1987 to Aegean Sea after Greece announced that it will start oil and gas exploration in the region. As Greece declared to intervene, Turkey responded that this would be cause of war. The tension calmed down later with mediation efforts of NATO and the USA.""), Imagine going down to the supermarket on an errant to find the shelves empty from panic buying... the threat was as is now real. At the same time I remember both the activities of the 17th of November dominating the headlines, the activities of Mossad against the Palestinians and the police brutality in marches etc still, all these threats never became a reason to hold societal progress in the 80's and 90's which was unstoppable."
6008,"[2015-11-19 13:40:31] <Emmy B> Such terror has little currency in Greece as a means of population control in a country with deep knowledge of conflict of war, real hardship and political persecution, concentration camps, juntas etc so recent in its history."
6009,"[2015-11-19 13:43:55] <Emmy B> I think this hysteria is very much driven by political powers for their own benefit, it is not society driven."
6010,"[2015-11-19 13:46:18] <Emmy B> Unfortunately Clinton has the power to fool, just like Obama, her sheep's skin completely disguises her nature. And having an ex-president for a husband...well in name recognition alone is very much there."
6011,[2015-11-19 13:46:39] <WikiLeaks> We believe it would be much better for GOP to win.
6012,[2015-11-19 13:47:28] <WikiLeaks> Dems+Media+liberals woudl then form a block to reign in their worst qualities.
6013,"[2015-11-19 13:48:22] <WikiLeaks> With Hillary in charge, GOP will be pushing for her worst qualities., dems+media+neoliberals will be mute."
6014,"[2015-11-19 13:50:18] <WikiLeaks> She's a bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath."
6015,[2015-11-19 13:51:24] <Emmy B> But Labour did not by any means stop the Lib/Tory government curtail their programme.
6016,[2015-11-19 13:52:35] <Emmy B> And the Republicans are very close to being fascists so *sigh* ...
6017,[2015-11-19 13:56:11] <Emmy B> It is very difficult to realistically believe in a political renaissance in the US.
6018,"[2015-11-19 13:57:55] <LibertarianLibrarian> No one will win with a large margin, unless people get angry enough to rally around a more outside candidate like Bernie S. But I doubt that. Personally, I'm more afraid of Hillary than anyone else. Some of the Rep candidates are repulsive but the system will keep them under its control. Hillary is too much in control of the controllers and, as WL said, she's a sadistic sociopath. She'll happily do what the PTB want. Some of the Republicans are nuts but that'll get shut down. They'll be a puppet like Obama. I am so scared of what's happening to my beloved America. Just terrified."
6019,"[2015-11-19 14:01:31] <Emmy B> Jenny, it is a large country and there will be pockets of liberality or places where local politics define life to a greater extend rather than Federal politics?"
6020,"[2015-11-19 14:03:51] <WikiLeaks> Exactly. Obama is just a centralizer. He's bad because representionally he does not look or act like that which he represents. Hillary has similar representation confusion, but she will actively lead the machine to a dark place."
6021,"[2015-11-19 14:06:11] <Emmy B> @ h agree. From outside looking in US has done it all, after world war II it has done it all, the torture, the foreign dictators, the Vietnams, Iraqs, Afghanistans... @ WL yes, it like having Psaki with a string of pearls deliver gov answers and policy of the most ruthless kind, but smiling and being altogether sweet. Horribly deceptive."
6022,"[2015-11-19 14:06:36] <WikiLeaks> GOP will generate a lot oposition, including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition."
6023,[2015-11-19 14:07:15] <WikiLeaks> Hence hillary has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP and has the will to do so.
6024,"[2015-11-19 14:12:04] <Emmy B> What would be the thing that will bring her down? (we know that for the US electorate foreign policy may not be as influential) From the internal political agenda, what policy would bring her down?"
6025,[2015-11-19 14:14:37] <Emmy B> What type of corruption would be the one that make her unelectable? financial fraud perhaps? or has she been involved in undermining the campaign of a fellow Democrat through dirty tricks?
6026,[2015-11-19 14:18:49] <Emmy B> But if she has spent years developing clients within every fraction of her party it is unlikely that they will disown her now.
6027,"[2015-11-19 14:21:06] <WikiLeaks> He role in the war in Libya is what should bring her down, however, the GOP is too close to others who have benefited to exploit this, it seems. That Hillary helped to sew the foundation for ISIS against pentagon generals advice seems huge."
6028,[2015-11-19 14:21:43] <WikiLeaks> But the GOP resolutely ignores it.
6029,[2015-11-19 14:22:40] <WikiLeaks> Hillary has so muc hslime on her shirt it is now hard to make dirt stick.
6030,"[2015-11-19 14:28:54] <LibertarianLibrarian> I think far more Americans are against Hillary than anyone realizes because the mass media is in her pocket. She's going to fail in most of the large geographical areas, but they're less populated, so you get the east/west coast population centers behind her and the rest of the country not."
6031,[2015-11-19 14:29:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> And Sanders could surprise her. He's a dark horse in this election and could shock a lot of people.
6032,"[2015-11-19 14:31:10] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, Emmy, this country is larger than Europe and has distinct cultural regions. I'm already planning my retirement to New Hampshire or Vermont or somewhere like that where local freedoms are held more dearly."
6033,"[2015-11-19 14:32:53] <LibertarianLibrarian> I'm just afraid this country is cracking at the seams. It can't maintain this sick, wicked policy of trying to control the entire world and still keep its own people from revolt. Ferguson was just a pre-shock, this isn't going to get better."
6034,"[2015-11-19 14:36:30] <LibertarianLibrarian> Americans, regardless of media portrayals or politicians (that system is rigged now) have a wide, deep streak of individualism. It's culturally-embedded. No matter how drugged they may think people are... there are limits. Which is why they're using Muslims and ISIS as boogeymen. Without that fear, their power center won't hold."

6065,"[2015-11-21 07:56:02] <Emmy B> Yes, you find great disagreement when the difference is material interest and the very thing US has been extremely successful in is to build material alliances, with groups within a country at all possible levels so much so that to even dream to extricate oneself from them would be anathema. And I am talking not only about issues where interests have been hammered down through corruption."
6066,[2015-11-21 07:57:15] <Emmy B> I see the same clientelism in Greece even now both towards the US/NATO as well as towards the EU. It is impossible to even dream an existence without these two poles of power.
6067,[2015-11-21 07:59:05] <Emmy B> And without dreams sadly the fear of change always overwhelms people and particularly as we have seen as recent as this summer in Greece groups who seek or hold or are supposed to hold in their hands the fate of a country.
6068,"[2015-11-21 08:02:10] <Emmy B> e.g. when I saw Tsipras Brookings photo opportunity recently standing next to ex US Ambassador in Athens Speckhard, the man who upon resigning his post immediately joined the Board of Directors of Proton Bank (lavrendiadis scandal) and six months later when the scandal broke out, the bank collapsed and was semi-nationalised to save it, Spekhard did a quick exit and never answered to prosecutors like the rest of the directors had to... what does one think?"

Does anyone have any doubt that such information will also be used by the dark state worldwide?"
6076,"[2015-11-21 12:00:56] <Emmy B> It is indeed disheartening that opposing such an opponent like the US CIA and destabilisation schemes harm the democracy they wish to protect. Problem though is what to do? counteract destabilisation schemes, bring about social change, push for stronger sovereignty at the same time as protecting the movement that brings about this social change. It seems US side has a double sided recipe to win. Whether US will claim Maduro is the new Assad or not the geopolitical game is without a mask by now. Syria says it all and we are all Syrians in the eyes of an absolute, unchallenged superpower. 11 million displaced not enough? Obviously not."

6207,"[2015-11-26 11:49:00] <Emmy B> A different perspective: Just listening an interesting analysis of AKP's surge in recent election results in Turkish West Coast (traditionally Republican) linked to Erdogan's policy towards Syrian Refugees including giving People smugglers impunity to operate highly profitable operations. Just imagine how much these 550,000 people have paid the locals and the impact on local economy."
6208,[2015-11-26 12:10:31] <WikiLeaks> Our pet conspiracy theory is that Erdogan took them in to train them up and use them as proxies and cannon fodder for his prospective invasion of Syria.
6209,"[2015-11-26 16:14:02] <Emmy B> Yes, bad news all for all around a worry to see Grey Wolves boots on the ground among the Turkmen. A clear intent to usurp any local Turkmen issue for this groups pan Turkic and racist agenda."
6210,[2015-11-26 16:19:19] <WikiLeaks> We think it is inevitable. Syria is weak and depopulated. Turkey continues to grow and is the traditional regional hegemon.
6211,[2015-11-26 16:20:18] <WikiLeaks> Only medium term question is whether it bites off half of Syria or just the Turkic areas.

6219,[2015-11-26 16:39:43] <WikiLeaks> It seems like the west is heading that way with the security/political/business class vs everyone else.
6220,"[2015-11-26 16:40:41] <WikiLeaks> In the short term its good for Greece that Turkey gets bogged down in Syria. In the medium-longer term bad, as you'll have to deal with a more militarised society."
6221,[2015-11-26 16:41:51] <Emmy B> It was a very effective islamisation or better put cultural assimilation tool via social climbing.
6222,[2015-11-26 16:42:54] <WikiLeaks> Yes. Malaysia now has a similar problem.
6223,"[2015-11-26 16:51:16] <Emmy B> 1. Turkey currently seeks and will succeed the legalisation of their occupation of 37% of Cyprus. They are not 'bogged down' i think they multi co-ordinate across points negotiating all the time creating opportunities for themselves. Eg refugee flows used to get access to Aegean via common petrols, Merkel has already agreed. 2. They carry on the same known imperial tactics as they did in the Balkans after the collapse of the cold war."

6235,[2015-11-27 01:53:48] <voidiss> Turkey's not-so-well-hidden &#821#8216;alliance' with ISIS could be itself a way to prepare an hypothetical invasion.
6236,"[2015-11-27 01:54:07] <voidiss> I mean, if they support ISIS, they have ISIS's support, and therefore they'd have 'local' forces on their side in Syria"

6240,[2015-11-27 02:04:39] <Emmy B> You can't but knowledge Turkish imperial tactics extremely potent i.e.:
6241,"[2015-11-27 02:06:38] <Emmy B> Official Game: 'We fight Isis, support Turkmen's Human Rights, fight Assad the dictator (ex 'Assad my brother') give US everything, fight the terrorists PKK'"
6242,"[2015-11-27 02:34:30] <Emmy B> Unofficial Game: Having deposed the Kemalist fraction from controlling the deep state including large part of the army/police/MIT via the ergenegon trials and arrests Erdogan now can control it. The new deep state reign retains all its business/legal and other societal channels and adding to that the part of society previously excluded or being kept under check the Islamist hopefuls. The presence of Grey Wolves in Syria's Turkmen community (publicly giving interviews about the shooting down of the Russian pilot) reveals their role and even gives it a public role. In retrospect the Ankara bombings who targeted Kurdish democratic rallies with their high death toll, fits the profile of a Grey Wolves operation. It is alright for Erdogan to conveniently claim 'it was ISIS' and fit with West's political hypocritical rhetoric about giving a damn for a problem they have created and sustain as a tool of furthering their influence and control in the region. The Ankara Bombing of Kurdish political wing by Turkey's deep state (via Grey Wolves) is no different to them bombing the Kurds in Nothern Iraq overtly. Let's not forget Grey Wolves attempted to kill Turgut Ozal Turkish Prime Minister in the 80's so not only their ambitions, properly sheltered by the deep state, have no end, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19880620&amp;id=7TNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5252,5375442&amp;hl=en"
6243,[2015-11-27 02:35:04] <Emmy B> See here what kind of politician Ozal was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Özal
6244,"[2015-11-27 02:49:18] <Emmy B> In January 1988 Papandreou and Ozal met in Davos and signed an agreement paving the way of de-escalating from the war path tensions prevalent at the time. Six months later an attempt was made in his life. Whilst Ozal was getting the bullet, Papandreou met severe criticism at home, a parliamentary challenge/censure to his government, leading to an eventual 'Mea Culpa""."
6245,"[2015-11-27 03:03:45] <Emmy B> In an anti-Davos March and afterwards open sky discussion in Athens Peace Park that I attended at the time, in the panel was a representative of the Kostadinupolites exiled community. He above everyone else in the Panel, fluent in both Turkish and Greek, understood and explained the Turkish imperial policy over the centuries having been part of the last Hellenic community of Turkey, in Istanbul, uprooted violently during the 1955 Progrom against Greeks. He was now in a state of perpetual exile in Athens, how ironic that he would feel this way living in the capital of Greece... still... he was right that this is the only way one should look at Turkish foreign policy: 1. Imperial (which includes a brutal disrespect for HR squashing dissent at home) 2. Long Term Expansionism and looking at the Big Picture."
6246,"[2015-11-27 03:10:24] <Emmy B> sorry I am meandering in other matters but let's say planned annexation of Turkmen Syrian lands came a bit of a surprise to me, Turkish state has been working on their annexation plans of Greek prefecture of Thraki more overtly, again the same template, ""we shall have to intervene to protect HR etc"": see here: ""The World's largest enclave"" http://www.mfa.gov.tr/and-the-world_s-largest-enclave.en.mfa"

But I was surprised that, despite the stuff about Cablegate changing nothing politically, he said this: ""But Cablegate also set the dawn of a whole new journalism model, able to disclose unpublished information to millions of people around the world"" and also that the article subheading (though granted, he probably didn't set that himself) is: ""Beyond the revelations, WikiLeaks association with five traditional media to disseminate 250,000 US diplomatic cables five years ago revolutionized our understanding of the actual foreign policy and inspired a new kind of 'whistleblowers'..."""
6288,"[2015-11-30 10:05:33] <WISE Up Action> My recollection (which may be wrong) is that he was loath to acknowledging that it was any kind of watershed a while back (a scoop, but not a watershed)?

6309,[2015-12-01 22:45:51] <Emmy B> M. Ignatiou reports that EU is building up pressure against Greece to let EU 'help' with border control under threat of expulsion from Schenken. Letting EU 'help' is seen with distrust in Greece as eg Merkel's crazy plan of joint patrols in Greek borders with Turkey illustrates. The fact is FRONTEX is already fully intergrated with Greek border control but it is underfunded and in the same position as Greek border control. What EU wants is a more aggressive closure of the border. Remember the WL leaked release on the subject. EU pushes for a military approach.

6457,"[2015-12-10 15:58:23] <voidiss> This would be great, even if they did simply to avoid criticism! Anyway, yes, it sounds just like that. Also... if the Swedish ruling class has this idea in mind, how could she know? It doesn't seem any media is reporting this kind of thing, and no one seems even to mention JA case."
6458,[2015-12-10 16:06:02] <voidiss> But isn't there the risk that if we tweet to her like that someone could equate this to people like Sands and her 'attacks' against her and SW?

I honestly never cease to be amazed by the total lack of nouse of the English chattering classes - they are soo narrow minded and thick it's beyond belief - they're like living in some artificial, pretentious fraction of human existence, and they're so stuck up their own arses they can't even conceive of the big wide world outside the rest of us live in."
6494,"[2015-12-11 12:56:37] <WISE Up Action> So his WHOLE premise for promoting the view that the suggestion the US were likely involved was entirely disingenuous, is that Julian didn't *mention* this in his statement to Swedish Police.

6495,[2015-12-11 12:59:53] <Emmy B> it does not stuck up because he is trying to justify the unjustifiable.

6612,"[2015-12-17 12:05:29] <voidiss> I'm doing a thing I'd like to share with you all... This year my school offered the partecipation in a project called NHSMUN (National High School Model United Nation), that is a big project initially created by IMUNA and organized by different associated orgs in each country (like Italian Diplomatic Academy in Italy). And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a 'simulation' of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a 'resolution'. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don't want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience 'how things work' in UN etc. A bit like 'know the enemy', lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway... today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I'll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast 'delegate' are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan. So, that is, I just wanted to let you all know about this thing because I think it's going to be interesting. I will share more about it! __"

6615,"[2015-12-17 13:08:22] <voidiss> Yes, they presented it as a good opportunity for hookups too, a way to bring young people closer to the diplomatic environment: in New York there will even be some orientation lectures about this specific post-high school path. But well, I can simply ignore this part and take the good parts of the project."

These meetings two out of four extensive meetings in 4 months had as content terrorism as well as co-operation btw US/Greek SS. The curious thing is, if Cable is dated 25th of Feb how is it that it does not mention the terrorist activity against Minister Chrysochoidis on the 17th of Feb (a bomb exploded in his electoral centre by terrorist organisation Laiki Thelisi). Heh the Cable does mention though that on the 9th of Feb Bikas was appearing at a parliament to answer questions about the 2004/5 wiretapping scandal.

This morning I followed one about the philosophical concept of privacy based on Hannah Arendt thoughts, and it was great. Also the one about the terrible line adopted by France in terms of surveillance was good, even if very depressing. Yesterday I followed one in which the speaker showed some photos from the Stasi archives which were hilarious (spies taking photos of enemy spies that was taking photos of them, or spies taking photos of themselves in mirrors). And the speaker also noted that while Stasi archives are more or less public and accessible, when he asked to the BND they gave him meaningless photos, so everyone can see how bad Stasi was but no one can see the crimes that surely also BND committed in that period."

6830,[2016-01-13 23:46:32] <voidiss> I used a WL cable for the NHSMUN's position paper on Palestinian refugees and put it into the resources list. PLUSD really helped me a lot!
6831,"[2016-01-13 23:47:42] <voidiss> It allowed me to find precise info abt formal position of a small country like Côte d'Ivoire, which was rather difficult to find in the web."
6832,[2016-01-13 23:49:45] <voidiss> Yesterday I had to send it to the Italian representative for the project and she told me to remove it b/c Americans could've opposed it.

6834,[2016-01-13 23:50:56] <WikiLeaks> pathetic.
6835,[2016-01-13 23:51:24] <voidiss> But I insisted &amp; in the end she let me keep it. Now it's been sent to US representatives; let's see if they accept it or oblige me to change
6836,[2016-01-13 23:51:48] <WikiLeaks> great. that's a much better lesson anyway.
6837,"[2016-01-13 23:53:32] <voidiss> Indeed! Yes, it was pathetic, she quite panicked when she saw it. ""Why have you put WikiLeaks in?! Do you know we're going to the US?""."
6838,[2016-01-13 23:53:42] <voidiss> Then when I started to argue she gave up.
6839,"[2016-01-13 23:54:50] <voidiss> By the way, being a 'delegate' is truly awful: you have to support the position of your country even if it's against your own."

6843,[2016-01-13 23:57:48] <voidiss> Exactly like that! It was quite difficult to complete the position paper indeed.
6844,"[2016-01-13 23:58:09] <voidiss> Côte d'Ivoire is a bit pro-Israel, it has always been one of the most Israel/US-supportive African countries (apart from a brief period)."
6845,"[2016-01-13 23:58:21] <voidiss> Therefore I was barred from proposing strong position on the Palestinian refugees problem, I had to keep a neutral/slightly pro-Israel line!"

6889,[2016-01-21 03:49:52] <voidiss> Fuck those Swedish assholes. They seem to enjoy playing these games with JA's freedom.
6890,"[2016-01-21 03:50:13] <voidiss> Yesterday the news were filled with 'in the next days', the questioning apparently was going to happen"
6891,[2016-01-21 03:50:17] <voidiss> and today they come up again with delaying tactics. And maybe they sent the wrong format on purpose. All of this is appalling.
6892,"[2016-01-21 03:52:51] <Emmy B> Prevarication, procrastination the name of the game today. MGT lawyer did not turn up to court, no explanation."
6893,[2016-01-21 04:58:55] <WikiLeaks> They have a history of sending the wron gformat. They did it with the UK and interpol also.
6894,[2016-01-21 05:00:30] <WikiLeaks> Swedish prosecutors just do whatever. They're completely unaccoutable. They're so provicial they think the rest of the world works the same way.

6900,[2016-01-21 09:07:49] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/690218424354672640 This is so unbelievably juvenile.
6901,[2016-01-21 09:19:05] <Emmy B> How could it be that the Swedish Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Affairs Ministry still let Ny embarrass them in such a way as if there has not been an MLA just signed?
6902,[2016-01-21 09:20:19] <Emmy B> and how is it Ny contents again in using a doc drafted in May 2015 before the agreement taking place and is not been ticked off about it by the Swedes themselves?
6903,"[2016-01-21 09:22:56] <Emmy B> Since the signing of the agreement Swden has de facto recognised JA's political Asylum, they should follow through and appoint a political representative from the Ministry of Justice or Affairs in following through with the implementation of the agreement, if they have failed to do so, Ny remains a loose cannon and will embarrass them further."
6904,"[2016-01-21 09:34:08] <WikiLeaks> Ny is a loose cannon. However, they put her in charge of all rape cases in Sweden a few years ago. To knock her off puts into question every Swedish rape case in the last few years."
6905,"[2016-01-21 10:15:03] <voidiss> And given that the criticisms to the Swedish judicial system are already too many, they don't want to lose even more reputation. The thing is that they're losing reputation anyway, exactly thanks to this way of thinking. It's like they are stuck into this vicious circle, oh poor them!"
6906,"[2016-01-21 10:22:58] <voidiss> Anyway, today in the UN course, the woman that explained to us the rules of procedure that we will have to follow during simulation literally said that what is really important to show is that you have studied and understood how the UN system works; it's way more fundamental ""to be respectful and use the right formal rules and formulations than to speak about the actual content of the resolutions"", the issues concerning the topics, etc (in other words, those who can manipulate words and use rhetoric win, not those who highlight important aspects). She also said that we're not here to change the world, just to prove that we're able to have proper relations with other delegates. Verrrrry nice, isn't it?"
6907,"[2016-01-21 11:42:54] <Emmy B> There is tremendous value in understanding how the system works, learning a process, so the course is not entirely without merit but of course the person leading the course could perhaps do a slightly better job in inspiring the class, an area that from what you described is lacking."
6908,"[2016-01-21 11:46:10] <Emmy B> Frankly, if I cast my fading memory, well, 30 years back I had some inspiring teachers and some who where complete bores, it is a collective experience of secondary education perhaps?"

6921,"[2016-01-22 06:17:32] <LibertarianLibrarian> I'm sure even the Swedes know by now that Ny is an international embarrassment to them, but they're stuck with her now. And she has political allies - after all, she got her position that way."

6948,"[2016-01-26 04:52:58] <WikiLeaks> So even though there's good content, we can't retweet it, because it feels too biased/ranty."

6950,"[2016-01-26 05:12:40] <voidiss> Uhm, got the point, it has to be more 'neutral'. Thanks for the explanation."
6951,[2016-01-26 05:17:53] <WikiLeaks> The problem is it feels like the author is trying to convince the reader of something- without declaring itself to be a polemic. Readers become defensive as a result and their minds close over to the factual presentation..
6952,[2016-01-26 05:33:49] <voidiss> Got what you mean.
6953,"[2016-01-26 05:34:15] <voidiss> But so, for ex, there're some Greenwald's or Rixstep's articles with a very harsh, polemical, maybe sarcastic tone, but are considered good."
6954,[2016-01-26 05:34:35] <voidiss> Is it because they declare themselves polemics?

6956,"[2016-01-26 05:41:10] <WikiLeaks> Exactly, their writing is punchier and funnier and doesn't pretend to be primarily analytical. It also somehow gives the impression that its on the ""side"" of the reader in mocking power."

7259,[2016-02-05 09:54:15] <LibertarianLibrarian> Craig Murray is always solid and on-point.
7260,"[2016-02-05 11:04:23] <voidiss> Wow, Craig Murray is going strong today: https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2016/02/philip-hammonds-astonishing-lie/"
7261,[2016-02-05 11:17:14] <WISE Up Action> That bag-thrower guy *seemed* to be well intentioned but just very impulsive and always pushing things. Stupid thing to do. Hope nothing more behind it.
7262,"[2016-02-05 13:11:51] <Emmy B> I videoed the person who tried to disrupt JA's speech, a fake charity worker collecting money in a bucket, wearing a funny Union Jack hat."
7263,"[2016-02-05 13:17:04] <Emmy B> I confronted him and he momentarily went away, after the speech was over he came up to me to say 'sorry I did not have anything against the guy but someone put 50 GBP in the bucket and asked me to do it, I did it for the children, I don't care where you are going to put the video"" He shook my hand, no hard feelings etc. I don't think he was truthful, in what he said anyway, later he had a large plastic bin bag and went around collecting all the rubbish left on the scene by the reporters, coffee cups etc. He was the second individual who tried to disrupt, for the first one, I complained to a police officer and twitted his photo, he did not bother us after that."
7264,[2016-02-05 13:17:58] <Emmy B> Plenty of interesting lessons in this journey.
7265,"[2016-02-05 13:21:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> I wouldn't be surprised if someone paid the guy to be disruptive. But, yes, I agree he's not likely a real charity worker. Good job handling both individuals."
7266,"[2016-02-05 13:22:41] <LibertarianLibrarian> I was so happy to see you all there on the video and photos! I've been with you in heart and mind, even though I'm stuck working through a blizzard here. Wish me luck driving home in the mess."
7267,"[2016-02-05 13:24:02] <LibertarianLibrarian> So happy to see Julian looking so well, though that cough he was fighting made me a little bit concerned. It's just so obscene he can't get proper medical care in this situation."
7268,"[2016-02-05 13:37:48] <Emmy B> Thank you Jenny, it was a bit intimidating when I first arrived with all the crowds of reporters but as more and more supporters arrived, things got better and better, in the end, we had a great time and what a treat to have Julian among us, and see he is looking well and share this moment of triumph!

7288,"[2016-02-06 04:16:38] <Emmy B> Here is the video from the Union Jack heckler I confronted yesterday, I have added a summary of what happened in the video's comments https://youtu.be/q5ZKAb5yx-8"
7289,"[2016-02-06 04:27:11] <WISE Up Action> Em he and Bob (vigiler) were squaring up at one point and I managed to get this guy away. He was saying the same stuff about costs, but when set him straight he seemed quite reasonable - shook my hand etc. don't know what he was actually doing, collecting money / picking up rubbish etc, he just kept coming back and blundering in. There was another guy with him up near Harrods. Some people just like cameras I think!"
7290,[2016-02-06 04:33:17] <Emmy B> Who paid him though to act in this way? and why be a willing actor to disrupt our efforts? Jim Curran who saw the affair from afar has confirmed to me the heckler is known in the area. And the efforts of 'reconciliation' also an attempt to influence my perception of him so I dismiss his behaviour as a blip and not expose him in a video. I don't expect MI5/MetPol Uni graduates to stoop so low as to dress up in a ridiculous hat and parade in this manner it is the willing stooges they use.
7291,[2016-02-06 04:37:04] <Emmy B> What this man was saying was identical to what the other 'gentleman' who looked like Alexander Downer (hehe) tried to do earlier I again confronted him and reported him to a police officer and twitted his photo as Mr Agitator. Having stood outside the embassy for so long I am aware that it is extremely rare to have members of the public behave in this manner towards JA's case. And to have two at the precise day and time pop up saying the same things? it is not normal.
7292,[2016-02-06 04:51:49] <WISE Up Action> True. Don't know why he kept coming back for another go. There did seem to be few strange characters around.

7374,"[2016-02-07 06:48:30] <WikiLeaks> But it's important to tackle the SW falsehoods by going back to her original statements about being railroaded etc. The transition to the current claims can only be explained by duress (the 'railroaded' / police made it up / refusal to sign events) or by inducements. We haven't wanted to push it for strategic reasons but there are SMSs that refer to borgstrom making cash inducements to SW that first week, where he says he's brokering deals and SW bragging to a friend about how she can get cash."
7375,"[2016-02-07 06:53:08] <WikiLeaks> We have wanted to permit an escape route for SW; pointing out that she was bragging about cash offers coming from borgstrom makes her look evil, which offers no easy escape and makes the narrative more complex."

I predict the legal establishment (am not talking about the DAG bottom of the barrel types) will be the first to capitulate to a new approach to JAs case because this political/MSM co-ordinated bullying and Hammond's disregard for UN ruling is a slap on the face of any legal framework. The more obvious is the political interference on a legal matters and their interference is unfolding most eloquently in front of our eyes the last few days, the more voices within the legal system will have to pull them back somehow, these are establishment subgroups in a tug of war between themselves for power. Yes politicians can bestow favour among the judges and Lords but disregarding/disrespecting UNWGAD the politicians slap the face of this country's legal establishment. The UK establishment has said far too much on the subject, in a show of power and the more they say the better."

7493,[2016-02-09 18:16:45] <WISE Up Action> Oh thanks M - that was quick! x
7494,[2016-02-09 21:53:56] <M> Here's a better quality one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ysfusMFs98
7495,[2016-02-09 22:26:10] <WISE Up Action> That's great. V. interesting to see Caroline Luv
7496,"[2016-02-09 22:27:06] <WISE Up Action> Lucas sitting in the middle of a rapturous greeting of JA, Hope it makes her think."
7497,[2016-02-09 23:03:59] <Emmy B> yes
7498,[2016-02-09 23:05:30] <Emmy B> I did not see her clapping but maybe I missed it.
7499,"[2016-02-09 23:26:24] <WISE Up Action> She looked conflicted. She was doing the same as everyone else but less - smiling and clapping but a little less (but that at's all speculation, really I suppose). I think it's good she was in an environment so very different from the oh so narrow British liberal scene and was forced to see how different people's attitude is."
7500,"[2016-02-09 23:28:28] <WISE Up Action> If you never looked away from this country, you might forget that JA is a hero to the rest of the world..so it's good she got reminded!"
7501,"[2016-02-09 23:48:00] <Emmy B> Thanks for the video M! you are right W she did clap and yes Westminster is so out of touch with what matters... or sometimes reality even...watching a good part of the debate to bomb Syria in 2015 the word 'Cyprus' never featured, one could have thought the planes where taking off from air bases in the UK and not from a small, country, half an hour's flight from ME, occupied by 40,000 Turkish Troops (the same Turkey that assists Daesh) but Westminster conveniently ignores this reality leading the entire country in this parallel reality immune from responsibility through ignorance of the truth."
7502,"[2016-02-09 23:51:03] <Emmy B> JA very much hit the nail on the head I thought with the references to War, destabilisation in EU, Shenken and losing sight of European interests. I now read Merkel's visit to Turkey brings home Erdogan's request for NATO's involvement in Refugee management in the Aegean. The ultimate anathema."
7503,"[2016-02-09 23:58:10] <Emmy B> Nato became an instrument of acquiescence used by US to pressure Greece to accept the Turkish invasion and occupation of Cyprus in 1974 on the pretext of holding stable the South Eastern flank of Nato. Prime Minister Karamanlis freshly returned from self exile in Paris, heading the newly restored post junta government removed Greece from Nato (albeit partly) in protest. So Nato must never be the guarantor of EU's soil or sea especially when it already sanctions and supports a Nato member illegally occupying Cyprus an EU member."
7504,[2016-02-09 23:59:17] <Emmy B> I see Nato in this respect the auctioneer of EU interests to outside interests to serve short term misguided US interests in the region.
7505,[2016-02-10 14:55:06] <WikiLeaks> EU's weakness can be see clearly when looking at its recent negoiation with Turkey over refugees

7508,[2016-02-10 15:35:08] <Emmy B> it worries me what JA said about the long night
7509,"[2016-02-10 19:38:17] <WISE Up Action> Yes. And as he intimates, the lack of vision is the heart of it. It's so bankrupt. Without vision, there's nothing - let alone anything sufficient to counter the evil."

7517,"[2016-02-11 11:20:59] <WISE Up Action> The LRB piece not too bad as a whole, but his main point is predicated on the oft touted (and of course totally erroneous) idea that the releases ceased after Cablegate. Research research! They just don't do any, do they?! Just a simple visit to WLs home page - and they can't stretch to it - so slack."
7518,"[2016-02-11 11:26:25] <M> Right. It read like a sneaky attack piece to me. That point especially, ""And, after all, when he ran out of secrets, his image was all he had left"", and referring to JA as a ""black hole""."
7519,"[2016-02-11 11:40:07] <WISE Up Action> Yes, I know. Just that there is some positive info in it and LRB readers will now be in receipt of that. But it's true it appears quite personal about both of them - more so about Ai Wei Wei I think. That he thinks the beach shot isn't recognisable amazes me. To me that image was shockingly, instantly recognisable, and an important reminder of the issues, though he's got a lot of flack for it not being 'sensitive' and this bloke seems to be capitalising on that."

7541,[2016-02-12 00:27:08] <Emmy B> ah! site links with Swedish Democrats Wikipedia calls it all names under the sun so his opinion will be easily dissmissed by JA opponents and could also be embarassing for friends https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avpixlat&amp;prev=search

Historically Swedes on our TL tended to troll, but nothing recently and only 'pro' activity. Small but may be something. (D)"

7562,"[2016-02-13 00:11:19] <Emmy B> Without being an expert, account holders can recover accounts within 30 days of deletion."
7563,[2016-02-13 00:53:45] <SAWC Sydney> after the 30days should we create a account and take the Twitter handle? so they can't use?
7564,[2016-02-13 01:10:37] <Emmy B> He's just cleaning his timeline or removing temporarily pending court case result he has not given up @supportJAdotcom for example
7565,"[2016-02-13 01:15:17] <WISE Up Action> I doubt he will stay away too long, Em. Good to have those 'Twiitter bad / FB good' tweets of his - can throw back at him in time. But yes, nicking the account name after 30 days would be a nice touch!"
7566,"[2016-02-13 06:05:06] <LibertarianLibrarian> Would be nice to steal away the account name, though Emmy's probably right about this being temporary ass-covering. But we can always hope some of the court cases are putting some fear of being caught into what little brain he has."
7567,[2016-02-13 06:47:26] <WikiLeaks> It very much looks like a setup.
7568,[2016-02-13 06:47:56] <WikiLeaks> Either in relation to the court case or an active Twitter policy dispute.

7590,[2016-02-13 12:02:42] <Emmy B> Now I am not going to throw my toy out of the pram but however hard I have tried MGT's ability to deceive has been beyond me.
7591,"[2016-02-13 12:05:44] <Emmy B> This interaction which we just see could have led to FB messages btw the 2 and eventually MGT's tactic of making ppl say the wrong thing (a tactic I saw numerous times) and then use it to create discourse, distrust, embarrassment and alienation could have damaged a person's goodwill towards WL/JA."
7592,"[2016-02-13 12:11:31] <Emmy B> Once I do an updated post on all the FB pages I will Tweet to Kevin about it. The interaction is from 2013 and seeing the his willingness to share info with 'Sunshine press' let's hope he has not shared anything else, considering his position. grumph!"
7593,"[2016-02-13 12:14:13] <WISE Up Action> Em, yes is it worth tweeting a warning message about FWLF people moving to FB and being wary of approaches there?"

7598,[2016-02-13 21:20:43] <Cabledrum> The closure of @wikileaks_forum is a very strange development. I have no idea what the reason for it could be. I can't imagine that MGT would ever give up this Twitter account voluntarily.
7599,"[2016-02-13 21:20:50] <Cabledrum> FWLF have reduced their activities on FB substantially in the past years. They only did approx. 300 FB posts last year, in contrast to more than 30,000 tweets."

7613,[2016-02-14 01:52:57] <Emmy B> permeates the ethers if nowhere else hehehe
7614,[2016-02-14 02:19:15] <WISE Up Action> MGTs #internetFriendsDay went well by the look of it. Haha
7615,[2016-02-14 10:27:25] <M> So any ideas why WLF would start with a fresh account? @wikileakz_forum At least with the 'z' they won't trick people into thinking they're legit.
7616,[2016-02-14 10:34:07] <WISE Up Action> Do you think it reads like a different author?
7617,"[2016-02-14 10:35:53] <M> I don't know. There's a few things that are off to me. One, it's retweeted some supportive things. And two, the followers/following don't have any of the usuals."
7618,[2016-02-14 10:36:23] <WISE Up Action> Yes agree. It's all a bit random.
7619,[2016-02-14 10:37:13] <WISE Up Action> And not the usual attack of MGT
7620,"[2016-02-14 10:37:48] <Cabledrum> FWLF announced to concentrate on FB but they didn't post anything on FB today. Also, there are only 2 forum posts today (average is approx. 40). Something serious is going on there"
7621,"[2016-02-14 10:38:03] <voidiss> The fact that he retweeted also some supportive things is similar to what he does in the FB pages. There are some positive, or at least neutral things there too. Maybe he wants to re-start with a less aggressive line due to the legal case?"
7622,[2016-02-14 10:45:31] <Emmy B> To my mind is certainly his present or anticipated legal troubles. Interestingly he did not blame his momentary departure to 'death threats' as in Oct 2012 (it only lasted a few days and then he was back) or to claims of organised attacks by WL or WLsup as he told the Steinitz woman in her two Stern articles. He spins it as a voluntary closure but he will be back. Anyway he has several socks going...so he is around and will continue spam the WL threads.
7623,"[2016-02-14 10:46:34] <Emmy B> I hope WL FB page block all his pages so he doesn't spam their threads, easily done."
7624,[2016-02-14 10:48:49] <Emmy B> If they do block his pages I wonder if he can still 'Like' the WL FB page which is displayed in his 'Likes' page section. It would be good if he can't.
7625,"[2016-02-14 12:09:03] <Cabledrum> I've just rechecked the real IP address of the FWLF server (hidden behind Cloudflare). The real IP still is 188.165.249.110, hosted by OVH in France, owned by MGT's wife [redacted]."

7644,[2016-02-15 09:57:21] <LibertarianLibrarian> Wonder if it will be more political spin AKA the UK or if Sweden is feeling the pressure &amp; is preparing to start getting out of its mess. Any bets?
7645,[2016-02-15 10:30:34] <WISE Up Action> Is that an Indian business channel? Strange fit.

7647,"[2016-02-15 10:34:56] <voidiss> Yes, agree. I'm too much of a pessimist for bets. I won't believe until I see."
7648,[2016-02-15 11:27:54] <WISE Up Action> Significant if Sweden publicly diss UN though.
7649,"[2016-02-15 11:28:57] <M> It further politicizes the case either way, which is not beneficial for Sweden."

7651,[2016-02-15 12:35:12] <LibertarianLibrarian> Not surprising. And even though they've violated the Swedish legal system rules multiple times in the case already.
7652,[2016-02-15 12:43:06] <Emmy B> Correct!
7653,"[2016-02-15 13:22:37] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/cambridgeunion/status/699329475897643008 Is he referring to the Swedish allegation as ""genuine charges"" here?"
7654,[2016-02-15 13:23:44] <WISE Up Action> See @AnonCopWatch
7655,"[2016-02-15 13:27:49] <M> That didn't clarify too much. It is difficult without context, but to me it reads as if its referring to Sweden e.g. ""US didn't make up Swedish allegations to get JA, they are legit""."
7656,"[2016-02-15 13:28:21] <M> I can't say I'm really buying this ""our very best source ever"" claim from AnonCopWatch re ""terrorism""."
7657,[2016-02-15 13:33:12] <WISE Up Action> The two (if there really were two?) tweets have a different emphasis
7658,"[2016-02-15 13:38:32] <M> But it seems they both can be read as either referring to Sweden or US (seeing as many Brits incorrectly use ""charges""). I don't know why there would be any purpose to changing the tweet except for accuracy/clarity &#8212; Cambridge Union posts videos of all the speeches eventually."
7659,"[2016-02-15 13:39:56] <M> To me, it seems far more likely that Grant is incorrectly referring to Swedish allegation as charges, as opposed to dropping a big bomb re the US case. But I'm interested in other analyses. It's likely we won't know for certain until the video is available, though."
7660,"[2016-02-15 13:42:03] <WISE Up Action> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/699327599382810625 Did you see this, M?"
7661,"[2016-02-15 13:43:47] <M> Yes. That's why I'm trying to pick apart the tweet. But again, it lacks context, as WL also pointed out."
7662,"[2016-02-15 13:53:14] <WISE Up Action> Whatever it means now (and as you say we won't really know w/o a vid), at some point, they may need to start subtly re-introducing the concept that any charges in the US should be seen as valid"

7664,"[2016-02-15 14:17:44] <LibertarianLibrarian> We all knew that was were it was going anyway, the Swedish stuff was always a smokescreen/smear campaign."
7665,[2016-02-15 15:41:57] <WikiLeaks> The 'corrected' CambridgeUnion tweet is more ambiguous.
7666,[2016-02-15 15:42:18] <WikiLeaks> It is hard to imagine the UK will pivot until the Swedish cas edrops.
7667,[2016-02-15 15:42:51] <WikiLeaks> But it's possible for people to get ahead of the timetable by mistake which is what seemed to be happening here.

7679,"[2016-02-16 08:52:39] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/AnonCopWatch/status/699330488998215682 Yes. This part threw me off too. I'm not sure why they would avoid naming direct deaths in Manning trial; it would actually further their case against JA to do so, imo."
7680,"[2016-02-16 09:21:38] <voidiss> IF this is the case, maybe they wanted to keep that particular charge and put it all on JA to worsen the case."
7681,"[2016-02-16 09:21:50] <voidiss> With Manning it was 'easier' because she's American. But you're right, it's still weird."
7682,"[2016-02-16 09:21:57] <voidiss> Anyway, if they really wanted to use direct terrorism charges for that, it'd be the worst outrage in history."

7685,[2016-02-16 12:55:00] <M> I think the point WL was making is that they already are going after them with a direct terrorism charge.

We'll survive, it just won't be pretty with either Hillary or Trump. But I'm still very worried about Hillary getting us into worse situations in the Middle East (it can, sadly, always get worse) and into wars with China and Russia, at the very least 'cold wars' but all her military corporate friends want to make money and that means boots on the ground in places they shouldn't be. Trump's more likely to go the isolationist route which is bad too but less bad and I still think a Trump Presidency would be a deadlock with Congress. 4 years of nothing. But I still think the GOP will get Cruz into the nomination by hook or crook or any means necessary."

In the Information market Google is trading, 'donating' space to celebrities and political personalities could be a disguised bribe. In the monopolistic position Google has carved for itself such 'bribes' serve only as barriers of entry to other players as the Monopoly from an economic power moves to couple with established political power. Whilst states have in the past tried and tested methods of breaking up monopolies/oligopolies, in the Information era, in the ether world, the proposition package offered to the shakers and movers of state (ie free PR access) and society is too attractive for any state institution or group to seek to legislate against it, at least in this current 'wildwest' market stage.

8115,"[2016-03-09 08:21:05] <Emmy B> What I hinted above is the following: Fredriksson was involved in a. 'exposing' vulnerabilities at Disqus b. 'exposing' Right-wing haters via Expressen collaboration. We now know Fredriksson was a SAPO agent. Therefore his actions had ulterior motives, other than the ones he professed. What would that motive be? a. generally snoop around and collect personal info as well as dirt on ppl that SAPO could lean on for political and other influence. b. create a name for his organisation for protecting privacy (!!!??? preposterous I know) and protecting the vulnerable. c. Focusing on 'haters', creating a scandal, contribute in massaging public opinion on how dangerous online hate speech is when right-wingers are involved, singing from the same song sheet that calls for censoring 'insulting online speech' after re-defining it as 'violence online' pushing public opinion in a certain direction."

8117,[2016-03-09 08:47:36] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/TomZdechovskyEP/status/707502470898049025
8118,"[2016-03-09 08:49:35] <Emmy B> *I know* i often thought during the public meeting I went to about the women (and the rest of the individuals) involved with the undercover agents how is it that for Example the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread surveillance or JA's 24/7 surveillance or WL revelations about surveillance were never mentioned. To me it feels the same political issue of surveillance. The study the organisers did showed that this practice (agents sleeping with the objects of surveillance) went on continuously for a period of 30 years, ie, it proves we are not dealing with isolated cases of rogue agents but of a practice that was propagated by the state actors. One of the lawyers suggested to criminalise for agents to have sex with people they surveill. Still despite the public attention that has been created, the play, the book, the documentary, the public enquiry, why is it that such highly political issue as state surveillance has been kind of de-politicised via its personalisation. Yes, the women who exposed this practice did so in a personal capacity, yes, there might be as a result some responsibility apportioned, some compensation given but it seems to me this is an isolationist approach, a de-politicization, compartmentalised. At a time when in the UK there is the snoopers charter very much in the news, and there are campaigns via ngo's civil society to push back, at the time when you have Jenny Jones scandalously been surveilled and lied on in FOI request for her files, time when Caroline Lucas legal action proved Wilson doctrine is a puff of air, time when JA surveilled 24/7 at enormous cost etc etc at the time when Trade Unionists expose and push back regarding blacklisting, why is it that all these matters are not unified under the same banner and find a loud political voice in Westminster. So yes, WL statement has various levels, 1. What does it take to create public opinion to react to the Fredriksson scandal? perhaps the personal drama of the women or men he was involved with sexually, even then it might be that society only sees the wrong in his conduct only under the prism of personal betrayal which they will describe as abuse. 2. What does it take for Swedish public opinion to see it is the Swedish state that is behaving in this manner, ie it is a political matter, that Fredriksson deceived, lied and manipulated because it was in his job description, he received a salary for it and he had a performance appraisal at the end of it, all paid for by the Swedish Taxpayer. 3. When does the Swedish public opinion define such behaviour as corruption, ie state surveilance, deception, manipulation is corruption, even in a 'democracy'."

8207,"[2016-03-13 07:41:16] <Emmy B> I forwarded S Hersh commentary on Syria to militaire, new greek national defence website, they immediately published it, his views, always valuable will reach an audience, the Greek military which views with alarm Nato activity in the Aegean, Turkeys bazar style bargaining with Nato and EU and a civil administration in Greece captured by the financial strangulation and the creditors demands."
8208,[2016-03-13 07:44:00] <Emmy B> If civil admin loses the confidence of the army Greece will go back to darkest days. Will the politicians left and right finally break through and effectively manage the crisis?
8209,[2016-03-13 07:44:04] <WikiLeaks> Greek title over the Islands close to Turkey are not sustainable from a military perspective
8210,"[2016-03-13 07:45:18] <WikiLeaks> Turkey is going to continue to harress them until Greece gives way, which it will."
8211,"[2016-03-13 07:46:47] <WikiLeaks> Unlikely to be a formal hander over, but Greece will have to make an informal concession at some stage."
8212,[2016-03-13 08:06:13] <Emmy B> Such a view is abhorrent. Last time US auctioned off Hellenic land to Turkey with the assistance of UK and Israel it took a military regime in Greece to act as their willing pawn.
8213,[2016-03-13 08:08:38] <Emmy B> The military regime was enabled because of internal political instability festered for decades by the greek palace. This factor is absent from Greek politics since 1974.
8214,[2016-03-13 08:13:46] <Emmy B> Turkey the aggressor has been indeed emboldened by the impunity they enjoyed 40 yrs on on Cyprus invasion and occupation. What perhaps is not understood in the West is that the ambitions are not just half the Aegean. For why should Turkey establish a naval vase in Albania?
8215,[2016-03-13 08:14:23] <Emmy B> I leave the conversation here __
8216,[2016-03-13 08:21:02] <Emmy B> But here is what happened in the region not that long ago http://www.britannica.com/topic/Balkan-Wars
8217,"[2016-03-13 11:07:01] <voidiss> This kind of slow, silent expansionism that we see in the Aegan makes me think that 'neutral zones' have no chance of survival in this world, because the most powerful country in question would surely find a way to slowly overcome the 'neutral' barrier. When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into 'international zone', therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that - even if the situation are different - this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a 'frontier zone' between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there's an established sovereignty, it's easy to create 'grey zones', make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world's attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it's clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too. Plus, if we consider that the external superpowers will help the powerful country in question (as NATO with Turkey, more or less), neutral zones can be nothing but facades."
8218,"[2016-03-13 11:13:48] <WikiLeaks> Emmy, it is not fair, but unless Greece installs Russian or Chinese bases on those Islands or something equally bold it is going to lose them bar Turkey being seriously weakened elsewhere."
8219,[2016-03-13 11:17:49] <WikiLeaks> Strategically it should make a settlement at the moment Turkey is weak and Greece is strong. But that won't happen due to Greece's political structure. So the settelment will come when Greece is at its weakest and Turkey is at its strongest.
8220,[2016-03-13 11:22:03] <WikiLeaks> Erodgan and company are intent on going back to pre-1914 borders as much as possible.
8221,"[2016-03-13 11:30:35] <Emmy B> Russia has never been serious neither will they be now. No idea about China. in 1770 (read Orlof) Greeks handed it on the plate, no Russia took what they wanted from Turkey after encouraging insurgency and revolution in Greece as a distraction, then dropped Greeks like a hot potato. In 1917 lost in their own revolution Russia was the first to sign peace treaty with Ataturk prompting the other 'great powers' of the time to scram in competition with the other to sign peace treaties with Turkey leaving Greek army in the middle of Anatolia fighting alone, a complete defeat that led to the catastrophic Lozanne treaty of 1923. In Yalta, they sold off Greece outright to the West despite having a very loyal communist led national army on their side. That is why I don't think they are serious.

Soon after the allies peace making and the defeat of the greek army meant there was no one to make the new Turkey comply with such articles. The Kurdish issue has reached certain maturity today. We are watching what will Russia will do, will they be successful in getting the Kurds to sit around the table at the UN peace negotiations for Syria? Will they clench the deal for a Syrian Kurdish state? They have invited Dimitras (Kurds in Turkey) to open offices in Moscow, will they follow through or will they damp them once they get what they want in Syria?"

8284,[2016-03-16 22:14:10] <Emmy B> Greek gov might fall
8285,"[2016-03-17 05:16:24] <WikiLeaks> Em, still happening?"
8286,[2016-03-17 08:43:00] <Emmy B> Crisis avoided for now. Junior gov partner 'Independent Greeks' convened a meeting and decided to support the government but they demand Refugee petty minister muzalas resignation over his error to call FYROM 'Macedonia' in public.
8287,"[2016-03-17 09:01:33] <Emmy B> Everyone is calling FYROM Macedonia, he got carried away and made a simple mistake for which he has apologised. The problem is not so much the name but the irredentism coming from FYROM with territorial claims and rhetoric identical to the 1940's Bulgarian Macedonian 'state' established by Burgaria in WWII. For those who do not know, Bulgaria was part of the Axis in WWII and one of the three occupying forces in Greece together with Italy and Germany. The Bulgarians were the worst of the three in occupying Greece because they materialised their strategic goal to access to the Aegean Archipelago. During the earlier 20th century Balkan Wars. Greece militarily defeated Bulgaria and so the newly liberated from Ottoman rule became part of Greece. Then there was an agreed exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria as a means to bring 'stability' which happened. In WWII Bulgaria as part of axis took the opportunity to be extra brutal as part of ethnic cleansing efforts to annex the area for good. After the war they paid reparations to Greece. That is why the FYROM rhetoric is so difficult to accept. On the surface everyone is talking 'what's in a name?' thinking Greece is unreasonable. But the issue is complex."
8288,"[2016-03-17 09:34:43] <Emmy B> No one in Greece is challenging FYROM's right to sovereignty self rule or borders. The collapse of the Iron curtain was looked favourably at home in the 90's as finally Greece would be able to trade with its northern neighbours. No one anticipated the irredentism and nationalistic bravado of the past that had dominated early 20th century geopolitics and state formation would be coming back to life as a result of the breakdown of Yugoslavia. 2.5 million of its southern inhabitants declared self rule. Great but why would they chose to alienate 20% of its population that is Albanian (they are not Slavs) by identifying with the Greek Macedonian identity whilst they are not Greek. They claim ancient Macedon was not Greek as if the two are mutually exclusive, a historical ignorance of mammoth proportions ""We call greek all those who share our culture"" was the definition of Greeks in ancient time (common language, religion, traditions, trading relations) but that world had dozens of kingdoms, city states, islands without formal state structure. Some shared alliances and others fought bitter wars between them. Phillip of Macedon was the first with the ambition to unite all Greeks under his Kingdom and Alexander the Great realised this ambition then went on to conquer other territories, the rest is history. To conclude, you could be a Greek and not a Macedon (eg you could be a Thracian Greek like Thukididis or an Athenian Greek like Pericles, a Spartian Greek like Leonidas) but you could not be a Macedon without being Greek."
8289,"[2016-03-17 09:43:33] <Emmy B> apologies for the long rants but you see it all ties in with the geopolitics of our era. I will put some links here in case anyone would like to read the issues. Could this issue bring down the government? Well I don't think the minority party 'Independent Greeks' would make such a fuss if it was not important for their long term electoral survival. On the other hand it shows the pressures this government is under when practically nothing goes its way. If a simple error has led to such crisis, the writing is on the wall."

8374,[2016-03-29 05:28:13] <WikiLeaks> We need to avoid a repeat of AKAWACA with JA4ME
8375,[2016-03-29 05:29:07] <WikiLeaks> There are certain similarities in the psychological profiles of the women behind both.
8376,[2016-03-29 05:32:59] <WikiLeaks> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/JA_4_Me/status/714787442885267456 For example
8377,[2016-03-29 05:34:07] <Emmy B> Ok will support hashtag excersizing caution since we don't really know them well enough or long enough. Graphics amazing though and someone certainly has the gift of the gab!
8378,[2016-03-29 05:34:08] <WikiLeaks> She's clearly highly motivated but please try to make sure she's not a single point of control/failure.
8379,"[2016-03-29 05:35:10] <WikiLeaks> The issue is more along the lines of if she goes rogue with that domain/social media accounts, how can the damage be minimised."
8380,[2016-03-29 05:39:29] <WikiLeaks> She's in berlin so there are some supports for her as long as she is there.
8381,"[2016-03-29 05:40:01] <Emmy B> A very ambitious beginning but very well done, i will make further enquiries blumoon cutie had something to say at some point that I did not"
8382,[2016-03-29 05:40:37] <Emmy B> Quite remember...
8383,[2016-03-29 05:41:55] <Emmy B> She was at the logan symposium Ping! Greta did you meet her there?
8384,"[2016-03-29 05:55:33] <voidiss> No, unfortunately didn't, I discovered she was there only after. What happened with AKAWACA? #JA4me seems a great initiative, at least it has legs, and the website looks amazing. If I have to be sincere, I got the impression that Suzie is a bit running her own show, but still, I don't know her, it may just be a wrong impression. What is wrong with that particular tweet? I mean, I don't know what 'psychological profiles' we're talking about since I wasn't here when AKAWACA thing happened, what's the problematic issue that may cause her to go rogue?"
8385,"[2016-03-29 06:04:56] <Emmy B> Oh akawaca was a group of great supporters in Oz who supported WL/JA but at the time the WL party was launched there they were invited to participate like other supporters groups. Sadly (to my mind) this was a grave mistake. One thing is activism another is party politics. There was a fall out and WACA went public abandoning the project at a crucial time, and damaging the election campaign irreparably."
8386,"[2016-03-29 06:06:12] <Emmy B> To go into further details would only open old wounds you can google wikileaks party, 2013"
8387,"[2016-03-29 06:24:39] <Emmy B> Re ja4me it is simply too early to say, WL is right to be cautious, strongly motivated people are so creative, and this has sprang out of nowhere and going 100 miles an hour. Let's hope when the tough gets going sensible hats will stay on __"
8388,[2016-03-29 06:57:29] <Bean> pretty sure that tweet was a joke to highlight the issue/Obama's hypocrisy
8389,[2016-03-29 06:59:15] <Bean> a central intention of the campaign is not having control centered in any one person - and is not a political party - but of course time will tell!
8390,"[2016-03-29 07:29:33] <Emmy B> Thanks Greta! Good observations. Thanks Bean yes, time will tell."
8391,"[2016-03-29 07:49:22] <M> Bean - Yes, which is why I joked in response. __"
8392,[2016-03-29 07:57:09] <M> I wish the #JA4Me website had a more positive color scheme. It looks like JA is being chased by apocalypse zombies. The grey is so grim.
8393,[2016-03-29 08:21:46] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/NickdMiller/status/714769171687600128
8394,"[2016-03-29 08:35:44] <WikiLeaks> Bean: We love the campaign, but if there is no overt structure there is a covert structure. A lot of 'leaderless' rhetoric is psycological cover for people who are very concerned about power gradients. This sensitivity to power can come from a desire not to be bossed around, but it can also come from another place. The first step to power is to stop others having power over you. The second step is to have power over others. In this case there are key assets such as twitter and the domain registration. Someone has these credentials and whoever does can exercise their person whims."
8395,[2016-03-29 08:35:51] <WikiLeaks> personal.
8396,"[2016-03-29 08:37:33] <WikiLeaks> Twitter, DNS, bank accounts etc, in this way create power problems, turning 'leaderless' movements into FBI movements, e.g Sabu."
8397,"[2016-03-29 08:39:26] <WikiLeaks> m, we don't mind the aesthetic. It's clear based on presentation this is not going to appeal to the middle class, but rather the lumpen prolitariat and teenagers. That's OK, since it is hard to have a campaign that appeals to both."
8398,"[2016-03-29 08:45:54] <WikiLeaks> Actually, the campaign should recognise that constraint and seek to use it to its advantage."
8399,"[2016-03-29 08:48:58] <WikiLeaks> In the case of AKAWKA these key assets, once developed though our ""support"", were then exploited by castro to wage a personal vendetta on JA to demonstrate her leverage. As leverage increases people expect concessions from us. We can't be in that position."
8400,"[2016-03-29 09:03:22] <voidiss> So what could be the strategy to avoid this centralization of key assets? Creating separate groups with some active #JA4me supporters and feed that channel in case of a 'gone rogue' eventuality? The management of the Twitter account is going to rotate, it's a good sign..."
8401,"[2016-03-29 09:12:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> Good thought, Greta. We just need to keep an eye on them and watch for signs of power-hungry personalities. Try to head then off and encourage the better aspects."
8402,"[2016-03-29 09:52:09] <Emmy B> Considering I swallowed MGT's lies hook line and sinker for a considerable time, and did his bidding for x number of months all in the name of supporting WL/JA I don't think I am the best judge, in fact, many of us were deceived, so I am taking WL concerns raised here seriously I really need to look into this properly. Also important to do this person justice. I will investigate. Thank you very much guys and girls <3"
8403,"[2016-03-29 09:56:18] <WikiLeaks> Just wish to repeat how important this is to understand many people in 'equalitarian' movements ""The first step to power is to stop others having power over you. The second step is to have power over others."""
8404,"[2016-03-29 10:02:21] <WikiLeaks> Through 'no leader' or 'we are all equals' rhetoric, those who have authority, deservered or not, can be pulled down to the same level as the ambitious. Then once the power aspirtant has one milimetre of covert advantage they're the boss of all. Should people challenge this state of affairs they can be described as attempting to gain leadership and surpressed."

8668,"[2016-04-09 00:57:29] <WISE Up Action> Emmy, WLF old main account still suspended? Has MGT bailed out?"
8669,"[2016-04-09 02:00:26] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/m_cetera/status/718725083322314752 Offered a nice, critical look."
8670,"[2016-04-09 02:06:21] <Emmy B> @ W - I could not tell you why the account is suspended Twitter has never taken action to over 80 individual complaints I have filed in the past against @wikileaks_forum account. Twitter has suspended MGT's account once in 2014 and another time in Sep 2015 in response to Chris's complaints. They have also been suspended once perhaps due to copyright violation, as they used an artwork without permission."
8671,"[2016-04-09 02:09:05] <Emmy B> I believe MGT de-activated account in Feb 2016 as a response to his legal troubles as a lot of the defamation was done against Chris and her family was in twitter, but he also has left proof of his identity there, as I document here: https://greekemmy.com/2016/01/30/mark-goeder-tarant-is-the-owner-of-the-fake-wikileaks-forum/"
8672,"[2016-04-09 02:15:01] <Emmy B> But he did re-activate for a few days in order to momentarily attack my efforts to inform people in UK about the paid 5th of Feb heckler. Personally I think he will be back, note that when Twitter permanently suspends they say so and this is not the case here."
8673,"[2016-04-09 02:23:32] <Emmy B> He might have masterminded the suspension himself in order to protect his account from being 'lost'. That is to say, if an account remains de-activated for certain amount of time then the handle becomes available again to be used by another user (you may not be aware but this is what happened to Christine Assange's original account, when she abandoned it, it was eventually picked up by MGT or his friends and used as a harassing account, and it is now on my list of troll accounts recommended for blocking) By becoming suspended he is in permanent limbo, being inactive but without the risk of losing the handle. As the twitter account is certainly in the midst of Chris's case against MGT, ultimately what we observe happening to it, reflects directly the outcome of the legal case and how MGT wishes to maneuver himself legally."

8686,"[2016-04-10 02:16:04] <voidiss> IMHO, maybe in this case it's better to avoid RT/Sputnik's articles on WL comments about attacks on Putin etc. They tend to twist the meaning, as if WL said the whole Panama Papers were set up to ruin Russia and all those things, while actually they only pointed out to the US funds and some outlets's focus on Putin. Otherwise it's like playing the game of those who say WL is FSB or other crap like that. No?"

8794,"[2016-04-23 05:38:05] <Emmy B> It has been done very carefully and accurately as far as I can see, the only thing I can raise, there is no culture of whistleblowing therefore, there is no word to describe whistleblowers, in the translation the word 'informant' is used which in Greek as well as in many other languages has negative connotations due to historic references, ie WWII etc."
8795,[2016-04-23 05:41:47] <Emmy B> There is an expression in Greek ______ ___ ______ ___ _________ ' hit the danger bell' which means 'to alert to danger' which would be more fitting and positive but has no noun that I can think of.
8796,[2016-04-23 05:44:35] <Emmy B> No Greek could ever aspire to be 'an informer' the word is stained. We need a neologism for 'a whistleblower'

8837,[2016-04-28 23:40:03] <Emmy B> As unaccountability of power which they possess leads to rampant abuse and destruction including self-destruction.
8838,[2016-04-29 01:29:20] <Cabledrum> The prosecutor has terminated the proceedings against MGT for perjury. We will contest this decision at the Prosecutor General.
8839,"[2016-04-29 01:29:52] <Cabledrum> This is the third criminal investigation against MGT that has been terminated without charge, despite clear evidence. Obviously, MGT enjoys some ""special protection""."

Any charity activity carried out by Peter Penfold should be reported to the police."" Hopefully he will now stay away from the vigil and Knightsbridge."
8847,[2016-05-03 07:31:03] <Cabledrum> I have finally lost the court case against MGT. The judgement cannot be appealed.
8848,[2016-05-03 07:31:07] <Cabledrum> This means that it is illegal under German law to use the photo of MGT. I have to remove the photo from my server immediately.
8849,[2016-05-03 07:31:14] <Cabledrum> Also it means that I have to pay approx. 18000 Euros (which I do not have).
8850,"[2016-05-03 07:31:28] <Cabledrum> I don't know any further details yet (I have to wait for the written judgement) but it smells very fishy. Even my lawyer says that he ""doesn't understand the world anymore."""
8851,"[2016-05-03 07:31:47] <Cabledrum> MGT has won both cases against PC and against me. 3 criminal complaints against him failed, despite clear evidence."
8852,[2016-05-03 07:31:54] <Cabledrum> This is extremely frustrating. All attempts to stop MGT's illegal actions have failed.
8853,"[2016-05-03 08:02:45] <Emmy B> I am very sorry for this Cabledrummer, I will assist with fundraising to cover the costs. <3"

8855,"[2016-05-03 08:15:51] <WikiLeaks> And PC's second case, when was that lost?"
8856,[2016-05-03 08:16:24] <WikiLeaks> Make sure you have your assets in areas which are hard to seize.
8857,"[2016-05-03 08:17:14] <WikiLeaks> You might be able to appeal to ECHR or UNHRC, though it will take years."
8858,[2016-05-03 08:17:35] <WikiLeaks> You have max six months to do so.
8859,"[2016-05-03 08:18:26] <WikiLeaks> ""doesn't understand the world anymore."" &#8212; that's either MGT's protections as a result of being an informant, or your lawyer not being very good and looking for an excuse."
8860,"[2016-05-03 08:22:21] <Emmy B> PC's second case was not lost. There was a partial win. MGT is been found responsible for all content on his site, ie Chris has proved her case, albeit Judges were not 100% sure on the twitter responsibility, so this part has not been won but has not been 'lost' either."
8861,[2016-05-03 08:23:32] <Emmy B> But his twitter is also suspended so in effect there is progress there too. Albeit I could not give you any particulars a this mo.
8862,"[2016-05-03 08:24:26] <Emmy B> @ Cabledrummer, I think let's wait for the details of the judgement and see what can be done! x"
8863,[2016-05-03 11:05:30] <Cabledrum> I lost in Nov 2015 before LG Frankfurt (regional court) and now (21 Apr) before OLG Frankfurt (higher court).
8864,"[2016-05-03 11:05:44] <Cabledrum> The court ruled that the verdict cannot be appealed before the Federal Supreme Court (""BGH"")."
8865,"[2016-05-03 11:06:13] <Cabledrum> ""doesn't understand the world anymore."" &#8212; No, not a bad lawyer but a *very* strange and unexpected decision of the court."
8866,[2016-05-03 11:06:43] <Cabledrum> Along with PC's case and the discontinued criminal proceedings it simply seems to be perversion of justice
8867,[2016-05-03 11:08:17] <WikiLeaks> The purpose of the 'justice' system is to enforce the power of state instution and the property rights of the wealthy. Any benefits in another direction are random.
8868,"[2016-05-03 11:09:19] <WikiLeaks> But they do tend to have good marketing. For instance, lawyers will tell the press that ""this case will be decided on the law"" because they know that it is unlikely to be decided on the law and they want to encourage the judge to decide on the law."
8869,"[2016-05-03 11:10:42] <WikiLeaks> Similarly, they tell people to dress well, because if you don't, judges will decide that you are further from the property-class/state, whose interests they are really engaged in trying to protect."
8870,"[2016-05-03 12:30:28] <Cabledrum> Similar to media censorship, I really would like to understand how it actually works. Do the judges decide on their own because they are biased against anything with the ""WikiLeaks"" label? Do they believe to do the right thing, even by violating the law? Or has someone from the ministry of the interior ""recommended"" how the judgement should look like?"
8871,"[2016-05-03 12:54:50] <Emmy B> Document everything and submit to a public depository for posterity, everything will eventually come out in the wash. Only a matter of time."

8877,[2016-05-05 04:33:15] <Emmy B> The tweet does not make sense and the link (a professor's profile) does not include the quote tweeted http://www.latrobe.edu.au/she/staff/profile?uname=sangelides
8878,[2016-05-05 04:34:38] <Emmy B> oh one of his accounts follows me.
8879,[2016-05-05 07:51:48] <Emmy B> Greek Member of Parliament Papachristopoulos mentions the IMF WikiLeaks leak in a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzK_7qJEywM

8881,[2016-05-05 07:56:48] <Emmy B> But the exact words do not mean admission the gov leaked the phonecall. It could very well mean that the gov chose to 'adopt' the leak and use it to the fullest rather than dismissing it and distancing itself from it as any previous government would have done.

8892,[2016-05-05 12:33:44] <Emmy B> As I thought he explains he meant that the GR gov raised the WL release at the highest levels and used it to its advantage.

8916,[2016-05-10 04:28:27] <Emmy B> The fact that DAG has taken such a strong interest in the Lauri Love case is highly disconcerting to me. That Courage Twitter keeps re-tweeting someone who has proven to follow the gov line on all matters WL/JA with such zeal is also of great concern.
8917,"[2016-05-10 04:32:07] <Emmy B> The RIPA 'safeguards' are hardly such, that the civil court decision celebrates RIPA is also greatly disconcerting.

Not only there is no reference in the article to WL but also When I search for 'wikileaks' on the page in general again there is no reference (eg, a tag or a part article etc).

9292,<p>The government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said that the eight arrested accused Turkey of violating the constitutional legitimacy and participation in coup aiming to overthrow democracy and hinted that it will be very difficult not to be extradited. She pointed out that all legal procedures will be adhered to but she stressed twice in a television interview in ERT that the offenses for which they are accused are very serious.
9293,<p>The point is a hot potato. An and the decision seems to be one way. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was the first western politician who publicly backed Erdogan and even at the time when it was not clear which side would prevail in Turkey. It is rather difficult now to refuse extradition of eight Turks seven military and a civilian.
9294,"<p>But because in Turkey they have already begun to seriously discuss the imposition of the death penalty even for some of those involved in the coup attempt, there is an issue! The EU does not ""cover"" us to extradite defendants in countries that may condemn them to death."

9317,[2016-07-17 03:56:38] <Emmy B> [Card-summary] http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/120138-160716-egypt-blocks-un-security-council-from-issuing-statement-condemning-turkey-coup from Egyptian perspective:
9318,"[2016-07-17 08:56:49] <Emmy B> As long as Erdogan remains in Istanbul or Constantinople the easier he fits the 'Sultan image' and that is to say the last sultan. One has to ask why he does not return to his seat of government, Ankara, Perhaps he has actually been de-throned and prefers to be near the exit, the millions who've followed the path before him into Europe for safety, let us see whether there will be a helicopter available to take him to safety when the time comes and what will be its nationality."
9319,"[2016-07-18 01:26:45] <Emmy B> Thousands attend/ed Gulen schools and associations are they all going to be targeted by Turkish state? Remember how bad things can get: progrom 1955 in Instabul 'cleansed' thousands, properties confiscated, businesses destroyed. This is not good."
9320,[2016-07-18 08:19:01] <Emmy B> Because of the political/military situation in Turkey any release could act as a release valve for a lot of tension. This may be very positive on the ground in Turkey long term but short term release may be spi
9321,[2016-07-18 08:19:21] <Emmy B> nned one way or another
9322,[2016-07-18 08:36:13] <WikiLeaks> Erdogan will spin it as a Gulen plot
9323,"[2016-07-18 09:04:42] <Emmy B> although he pushes that line Gulen=terrorist organisation etc etc perhaps the real danger to his power is the people closest to him within his party who perhaps wish to retain some of their power and see him as a liability. I have no idea if indeed Gulen had anything to do with the plot, or his sympathisers did, how could I, but Erdogan has marked them as his enemy and so it is. The Gulenist supporters sympathisers, if we believe the US embassy cables as an accurate source is into millions within Turkey, imagine how many have gone to the schools, have been in Gulenist trade associations or charities, Erdogan paints with the brush of terrorists a very large part of the population, it is extraordinary how he chose to act with purging thousands from positions of state, in the legal,judicial profession, the army, the police, kind of disintegrating the state and terrorising a huge part of the state apparatus and the population, introducing a chaos element within his own ranks. The enemy within, instead of 'The Kurds', 'The Greeks' 'The Armenians' 'The Laz' . I wonder how he can sustain this in the medium or long term. I get the feeling things are very much in flux. Neither can we assume that the external powers to be are currently idle. Considering the importance of Turkey militarily, Erdogan is now a liability for them too, I don't know why Egypt comes to mind, perhaps because they were the only ones in UN not to condemn the coup attempt."
9324,"[2016-07-18 09:05:54] <Emmy B> it is a complex situation hopefully the new release will help many to understand the situation and in fact, calm things down"
9325,[2016-07-18 09:06:32] <Emmy B> it may also offer distraction and focus minds
9326,[2016-07-18 09:07:20] <Emmy B> at the mo everything is frozen by violence or the threat of violence
9327,[2016-07-18 09:07:38] <WikiLeaks> Listing Gulen as a terrorist group a month ago would have put many in a dangerous position.
9328,[2016-07-18 09:07:47] <WikiLeaks> So coup could be gulen related.
9329,"[2016-07-18 09:09:34] <Emmy B> it is inevitable, event if he himself does not pull the strings, the thousands associated with the movement have been active state actors for years, in fact they were for years Erdogan's power base supporting his rise to power, as per US Embassy cables"
9330,"[2016-07-18 09:17:06] <Emmy B> it is just the scale of Erdogan's intention to criminalise potentially hundreds of thousand of people... on the other hand, Kurds have been at the receiving end of such discrimination for decades upon decades, previously Armenians, Greeks ethnically cleansed so society it seems is willing to accept such mass scale criminalisation of groups of people? but difficult to understand really what is happening. Trying to make parallels with other countries... de-baathification perhaps in Iraq, but it was done by an external occupying force, or the exclusion from power of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt... but again it is different."

9788,"[2016-09-08 14:11:57] <Emmy B> Mixed, we were asked by the guard/policeman to stand away from the entrance so we could not engage with everyone handing flyers but wait for those who came to approach us. Most who spoke to us were journalists who were curious but with short exchanges. SVT journalist very courteous another lady journalist was hostile, 2 women who worked with the police told us we should not be there, it was wrong for us to be there and that someone would come out soon to tell us, then they left, when a uniformed man came out he was alright just asked us to move to the other side. Many took photos or short videos silently, many smiled back, some where happy to see our messages, others enquired with specific questions. One man working with the police (plain clothes) said we should not be protesting at the police as this had nothing to do with the police it was the prosecution who was responsible, I explained that it was Marianne Ny that chose the venue, this police station and that is why we were there, he seemed embarassed."
9789,"[2016-09-08 14:16:51] <Emmy B> The place we were sitting was not a thoroughfare, so we were mostly seen by the people who came and left from the building of the police station, mostly the ppl attending the press conference and others who had business with the police station."
9790,"[2016-09-08 14:31:22] <Emmy B> I got the impression the location is not used to protests, even gentle ones like ours. I felt we were a surprise, was very pleased with the action and how things went. Only we did not see Marianne Ny herself coming in or out.

I also observe this budding support is inclusive towards WL as well as Manning Snowden ie the enlightening movement of transparency. Good stuff <3"

10223,"[2016-10-26 16:45:07] <M> Right. I guess my point is, Malik Obama is not a person of power or influence, so a statement of support from him is not really that meaningful."

10235,"[2016-10-27 09:39:39] <Emmy B> I agree, considering #PodestaEmails speak eloquently of MSM's collusion with Clinton establishment this is the result of 'we have been found out'. Part of the political umbrella. But the threat is real for them as they are thinking journo's e-mails might be next on the list as WL 'does not hold anything as sacred' remember JA's Trafalgar speech 8.10.2011 'Journalists are war criminals'? perhaps some realise they might be next on the list as power actors. Sadly Greenwald/Wolf tet-a-tet discussion about privacy is both an expression of such fear and the development of an effective talking point. Suddenly WL threatens privacy. Perhaps end to end strong encryption advocates should provide the antithesis to such argument and demand such universal standard in online communications, a reference to Cypherpunks made by JA recently."

10301,[2016-11-04 13:37:00] <WISE Up Action> Oh Christ
10302,"[2016-11-04 14:27:17] <M> I don't understand the push of all the satanic rutual articles. The email is a weird invitation, but the articles go on to assume he took part in it etc etc."
10303,[2016-11-04 14:28:22] <Emmy B> which one?
10304,[2016-11-04 14:29:10] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/LifeZette/status/794638355178934272 This and similar previous ones.
10305,[2016-11-04 14:29:42] <M> Especially with such a misleading headline.
10306,"[2016-11-04 14:34:23] <LibertarianLibrarian> That whole thing is totally bizarre. Then again, anything the Clinton's and their cronies are into wouldn't surprise me too much."
10307,[2016-11-04 14:37:27] <Emmy B> If writers of articles are Trump supporters it makes sense to put a lot more in the story to put off Christian voters against Podesta. There is real deep fear for satan/occult practices (I am given talismans every time I go to Greece for perceived protection of me and the kids from the evil eye/satan and all sorts) among Christians as this is a major pre-occupation of organised religion.
10308,[2016-11-04 14:48:36] <Emmy B> let's not forget the origin of the term 'witch hunt'
10309,[2016-11-04 14:50:52] <M> [Tweet] https://twitter.com/snopes/status/794657572754247684
10310,"[2016-11-04 14:50:58] <Emmy B> when I say the fear is real, I will also put some context, early Christians were accused of drinking blood and practising cannibalism etc (holy communion misunderstood)"
10311,[2016-11-04 14:52:40] <Emmy B> it is a can of worms as well as the stuff of comic strips
10312,[2016-11-04 14:53:19] <M> Right. The term comes from persecuting people based on ridiculous notions. So the hypothesis that Podesta participated in Satanic rituals should not be pushed because it distracts from his actual corrupt practices.
10313,"[2016-11-04 14:58:50] <Emmy B> I am not saying that Podesta did anything like that. Still, the fear is real among Christian communities since, let's face it, organised religion has a lot of rituals that are controlled by priests but if they are performed by lay people, it is taboo, shocking. I am not familiar with the artist in question but the theme plays to the darkest fears and instincts of people."
10314,"[2016-11-04 14:59:52] <LibertarianLibrarian> It's certainly not as important as the obvious corruption, but it symbolic of the attitude of these people who think they can do anything and get away with it. In that sense, only, it's worth noting."
10315,"[2016-11-04 15:10:25] <Emmy B> PS in Greece, very much dominated by a Christian culture there are often scandals about satanists or occult practices, and people tremble. There is belief in the 'evil eye', reading the future in coffee cups, and sometimes one wonders where religion ends and magic begins as it gets blurry. __ but in a set beliefs which accepts miracles and supernatural power like Christian communities do, there is also a recognition that evil powers exist represented by Satan, at a mild modern context the yin and yang but for organised church as well as people who believe, this is real. In our modern world we demand rationality above all in public office rather any sort of mumbo-jumbo although let's not forget her 'majesty the queen' is also head of the church of England :-p for Podesta this story is bad news."
10316,[2016-11-04 15:14:00] <M> Another of the emails confirms that John Podesta didn't go https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25325
10317,"[2016-11-04 15:19:34] <Emmy B> true, but 'Marina missed you' implies familiarity ie they might know each other quite well. (the truth is if one wants to interpret the matter in a certain way they will)"
10318,[2016-11-04 15:22:01] <M> More here. It's just a stupid lead to chase. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/11/04/no-john-podesta-didnt-drink-bodily-fluids-at-a-secret-satanist-dinner/?tid=sm_tw
10319,"[2016-11-04 15:23:07] <Emmy B> The worst things will be if he is forced to make a statement on the matter, then whatever he says will feed into the circle of gossip, it is the taboo aspect of the matter which is simply toxic. He may be dropped from the dinner list of many a Christian believe me, quietly."
10320,[2016-11-04 15:34:34] <LibertarianLibrarian> Can't say I feel sorry for him.

10322,"[2016-11-04 15:48:49] <WikiLeaks> ""Marina missed you"" and ""at the appartment"" implies something rather close."
10323,[2016-11-04 15:50:06] <WikiLeaks> A lot of US east coast elite play with esotericism as a status signal to other elites. Like having a psychiatrist was a status signal.

10365,"[2016-11-09 04:29:43] <Bean> yes all of these challenges for the establishment are absorbed &amp; manipulated to suit, but process is chaotic and so more cracks appear + establishment must embrace more overtly repressive tactics in that process - complete with xenophobia and all that other fun stuff (due to where the challenges are coming from) - also not necessarily in their interests re maintaining power and their global economy"

10367,"[2016-11-09 04:33:25] <WISE Up Action> Media likes to simplify but similar to Brexit, different communities have different motivations and it's complicated. Again though yes frustration gets a vehicle and from people off the radar of political establishment and media bubble. Trump will be boxed in, he'll have to be. Interesting how that will play out. Remember his poor relations with GOP elite now."
10368,"[2016-11-09 04:59:13] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, he'll have a fight with all of Congress to get anything done. It'll deadlock him.

10369,"[2016-11-09 05:12:54] <WISE Up Action> Feel Brexit always led by a power struggle between existing (Tory) elites with Farage gleefully intervening in Ordinary Bloke guise. Though Trump playing that character, absence of rival elite with GOP folding so quickly? Just my take.."
10370,"[2016-11-09 05:15:26] <LibertarianLibrarian> The GOP has been falling apart for a while. This isn't a win for them, it's just showing the Dems are in just as bad shape. There will party shakeups. That will be the interesting part."

10405,"[2016-11-12 14:02:39] <Emmy B> I know it is slightly off-topic here but Obama is to visit Athens this week possibly Monday the 14th. I read about what he will speak about, eg Turkey. The latter is very unstable, several politicians currently in gov and outside have been making bold declarations against Greek sovereignty derived by the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal. That Obama chooses to visit is very curious to me. Their influence over IMF and Merkel regarding the debt and its forgiveness (not real forgiveness but a vehicle to manage it to allow some growth) is said to be Obama's 'gift' A lot will be said about the visit, (he will also visit the island of Lesbos) this week, it is an opportunity to tweet WL's most recent release about Greece and Cables full of the various national security problems described in them including Cyprus."
10406,"[2016-11-12 14:18:21] <Emmy B> The week is not the best for a US presidential visit, on the 17th of November, a national day dedicated to the struggle for democracy when students, workers and others rose up in rebellion in 1973 to oppose the CIA backed junta and were brutally killed. 17 years ago Clinton visited Greece and half apologised for the US role in supporting the junta. Again there are plenty of WL Cables on the subject. These may be the issues in the news regarding his visit."

10462,[2016-11-21 07:25:54] <WikiLeaks> there is a .press
10463,[2016-11-21 07:27:00] <WikiLeaks> Why did he ask a dumb question about 'police guard'?
10464,"[2016-11-21 08:41:40] <Emmy B> he is new in politics and first time member of london assembly in last May's elections so he has never received my previous letters on the issue. I will be writing back this time directly to him (previously I wrote a general letter to all assembly members) with an opportunity to inform him better on the particular issues. He says he may ask a further question to the Mayor, so I better start thinking of suggestions, any ideas would be most welcome. Thanks."
10465,[2016-11-21 08:58:12] <WikiLeaks> All question sasked by them in the last six months about JA have been useless because they were no worded carefully enough.
10466,[2016-11-21 08:58:37] <WikiLeaks> [other than demonstrating that people are bothered to ask questions which is not nothing]
10467,[2016-11-21 09:22:46] <WISE Up Action> Didn't realise someone had actually been arrested for this.
10468,[2016-11-21 09:32:39] <Emmy B> @ wiseup it is the first time this information comes into the public sphere.
10469,"[2016-11-21 09:37:54] <Emmy B> @ wl, perhaps there is a chance now"
10470,[2016-11-21 09:40:21] <Emmy B> what kind of question would be useful?
10471,[2016-11-21 10:02:50] <WikiLeaks> Give some suggestions
10472,[2016-11-21 10:15:15] <Emmy B> Any questions have to be relevant to the responsibilities of the Mayor and the controlling function of the London Assembly otherwise they will not be within its remit to question and expect an answer.
10473,"[2016-11-21 10:18:30] <Emmy B> Mr Kurten suggests: ""I may ask a further question asking what the Met is doing to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Mr. Assange and the other residents of the Embassy given the recent incident."
10474,"<p>I hope that these answers from the Mayor are useful. Do let me know if there are any further questions you would like me to put to the Mayor about Mr. Assange and his situation, although I believe that ultimately it is only central government in Westminster which can lift the threats against him."""
10475,[2016-11-21 10:21:54] <Emmy B> Perhaps the question should fine-tune 'wellbeing' to include a question regarding access to appropriate medical care defined by JA's published medical records?
10476,[2016-11-21 10:26:33] <Emmy B> A different direction of questioning perhaps could include Mayor's and Commissioner's responsibilities for the safety and wellbeing of JA and Embassy people particularly in view of UNWGAD (Sadiq Khan has been a human rights lawyer) and as the most surveilled embassy in the world.
10477,[2016-11-21 10:27:30] <Emmy B> of course any recommendations on my part may not be taken up by Mr Kurten but I can certainly try.
10478,"[2016-11-21 12:09:58] <WikiLeaks> No, it's not helpful. All that will do is increase surveillance."
10479,[2016-11-21 12:10:21] <WikiLeaks> The questions should be arround refusal to reveal the spend
10480,[2016-11-21 12:10:27] <WikiLeaks> or about the robot cameras etc
10481,[2016-11-21 12:10:45] <WikiLeaks> or about why it was legit to spend that much $ in the first place if it wasn't in the second
10482,[2016-11-21 12:10:53] <WikiLeaks> or about have they request sweden pay
10483,"[2016-11-21 12:11:02] <WikiLeaks> requested that sweden pay and if not, why not"
10484,[2016-11-21 12:11:46] <WikiLeaks> in the swedish supreme court response by the swedish prosecution they state that the UK has never asked them to pay hence they do not have to factor in the expense into the proportionality of what they are doing
10485,[2016-11-21 12:12:31] <WikiLeaks> doubt it is the most surveilled embassy in the world
10486,[2016-11-21 12:12:47] <WikiLeaks> US embassy in moscow for example likely has greater
10487,"[2016-11-21 12:19:52] <Emmy B> ok, thank you very much this is a good direction, I will go towards that end and let's see what we get."
10488,[2016-11-21 12:25:01] <WikiLeaks> The second point is probably good. The also avoid FOIA on the budget citing national security reasons
10489,[2016-11-21 12:25:10] <WikiLeaks> they
10490,"[2016-11-21 12:30:13] <Emmy B> sorry by second point do you mean my second point ""Mayor's and Commissioner's responsibilities for the safety and wellbeing of JA and Embassy people particularly in view of UNWGAD"" or your second point ""about the robot cameras etc"""

10509,"[2016-11-23 14:06:31] <Emmy B> I would like to see London Mayor Mr Khan, a human rights lawyer, no less, say otherwise if he dares..."
10510,[2016-11-24 17:39:20] <M> Online polls are a pretty silly thing. Modi has suddenly leapt SO far in the lead in the TIME poll - there must be a concerted effort to get him to win.
10511,[2016-11-24 17:40:14] <WikiLeaks> Something is not right with that tme poll.
10512,[2016-11-24 17:40:31] <WikiLeaks> JA was at 14%
10513,"[2016-11-24 17:41:03] <WikiLeaks> But more seriously, if you go through the poll subjects you can see how many people voted yes/no for them."
10514,[2016-11-24 17:41:21] <WikiLeaks> 65% voted yes for JA
10515,[2016-11-24 17:41:33] <WikiLeaks> But half that for modi.
10516,"[2016-11-24 17:43:28] <LibertarianLibrarian> That kind of poll is probably very easy to manipulate, either by Time or by external people wanting to force a certain result."
10517,"[2016-11-24 17:44:03] <M> Well it's weird too because you don't have to go through the whole poll for your vote to count, but you do have to do it in order."
10518,[2016-11-24 17:44:37] <M> So people can just vote yes on JA and nothing else. But if you want to vote yes on Modi you have to vote on 20 others to get there.
10519,"[2016-11-24 17:50:58] <M> Account based polls may have some worth, but anything that's 100% open doesn't offer any useful results or data. Except maybe who can round up the biggest online army."
10520,"[2016-11-24 17:54:14] <LibertarianLibrarian> True, and they're vulnerable to any nut with computer skills and too much time on their hands."
10521,[2016-11-24 18:05:56] <WikiLeaks> Are you sure you don't have to go through the whole poll for your vote to count?
10522,"[2016-11-24 18:07:15] <WikiLeaks> There is also their ""Face to Face"" poll which has toaly unclear weighting."
10523,[2016-11-24 18:07:33] <M> No not certain. It just seems that way since it shows the results after each vote.
10524,[2016-11-24 18:07:44] <WikiLeaks> Yes. It's a meassure of who can collect the most people/high quality bots. But that is a measure of something important.

""Answer by the Mayor """
10563,<p>The Police are obliged to execute the European Arrest Warrant for Mr Assange and will do so should he choose to leave the Ecuadorean embassy.
10564,"<p>Regarding the attempted break-in at the Embassy, I am assured that the MPS continually assess the security arrangements of all diplomatic premises in London. Clearly, it would not be appropriate to detail these publicly."""
10565,[2016-12-06 03:16:40] <Emmy B> I note that the Mayors reply focuses on the EAW and not on 'he broke his bail' mantra.

How on earth Trump is going to be allowed to go forward with a change in foreign policy?A recent Greek PM Karamanlis who tried to re-approach with Russia (without compromising Greece's commitment to Nato) and the Pythia op planned his assassination by US interests, he resigned before the end of his term triggering an election.

I'm delighted to see Clinton's anti-Russia agitating didn't get further, but I'm worried a bit re China. Trump will have to be careful there. But I can see Trump and Putin siding together more in regards to the Middle East. Not sure if that will be a disaster or a success, probably a mix, but I'm sick of this resurgent McCarthyism recently. Bad, bad, bad idea. Trump's a wild card.

10648,"[2017-01-07 16:06:01] <LibertarianLibrarian> It's really bizarre how Americans have been led to believe simultaneously that Julian is under Putin's thumb and that he's gone 'right wing', both of which are clearly absurd and contradictory with each other (as most Americans still associate Russia with communism to some degree). Sarah Palin (this no endorsement of her) was ridiculed for saying the Russians are coming... Yet now it's Clinton saying the same thing and suddenly it's not ridiculous? I don't get people sometimes. Believe it or not, there actually is something between your ears. Try using for it a change. Argh! Then again, Senator Schumer may actually NOT have any thing between his ears."
10649,[2017-01-07 16:12:39] <Emmy B> hahaha
10650,[2017-01-07 16:12:44] <Emmy B> <3
10651,[2017-01-07 16:13:24] <Emmy B> very good points there Jenny!
10652,"[2017-01-07 16:18:59] <LibertarianLibrarian> Thanks. Just letting off steam. The whole Putin is the bad guy thing is absurd and out of hand. And why can't people get the simple concept that WL can only release what it's been given, can't magically make up stuff on Trump. And source is irrelevant, all the stuff on Clinton and DNC is TRUE however bad Trump may or may not be. Like Duh!!! When otherwise intelligent people repeat this stuff... *steam comes out of my ears*"
10653,"[2017-01-07 16:35:04] <Emmy B> The thing is why didn't the pro-Clinton media found good stuff for Clinton in the Podesta e-mails? it was her campaign manager after all, if they found nothing good about her in there well he was at least a lousy campaign manager, I have not heard one bad word written about him, complete denial of any responsibility. Yet they let their country go through this turmoil of 'Russia phobia' as if they are some kind of banana republic. How will the rest of the world see the US intelligence services playing the role that they do and Obama encouraging the 'I am shaking in my boots because of little Russia' the elephant scared of the mouse kind of thing, US has 900 military bases around the world is this the way to behave for internal consumption and to protect the gravy train deals with Saudi and the rest of ME tyrants? Is it worth it? I mean , is this the American Dream? The CIA, Clinton and friends are damaging the Brand US but perhaps it is not a bad thing...who knows, so much dust we just have to wait till it settles."
10654,"[2017-01-07 16:39:38] <LibertarianLibrarian> Yes, good point re Podesta. I have no clue what will happen Trump is a wild card which may actually be a good thing, at the least we can watch the Washington power brokers running around after him which will be highly amusing (if they don-t gag him or worse first)."
10655,"[2017-01-07 16:46:12] <Emmy B> He has not held a single political office, what allies may he have in Washington, I don't know, the Republicans may be in the end the ones to control him, having Congress and Senate and President a lot can be done, but with such 'secure' environment for passing law, a weak opposition, perhaps we will see fractions within the Republicans playing both government and opposition. When was the last time that all three Con/Sen/Pre belong to the same party, and when are there elections for Congress again?"
10656,"[2017-01-07 16:55:45] <LibertarianLibrarian> Hmm, not sure last time all 3 in same party, though a lot of Republicans are anti-Trump. So who knows? Congressional terms are 2 years. I think they are staggered so some up every year. Senators are 4 years, and I think staggered as well. Some should be up in 2017, and definitely in 2018, etc. I'm pretty sure."
10657,"[2017-01-07 17:00:58] <Emmy B> Well if the Democrats get their act together they might stand a chance, but some fresh air will be badly needed they missed their chance with Sanders to bring in some new ideas and re-allignment with what the times require to mobile voters, how long will they be involved in this self-defeating policy of the 'burnt land' since they lost. Alternatively, it might give an opportunity to other parties to move in fill the vacuum."

10753,"[2017-03-08 11:50:30] <Emmy B> Regarding the WIkiLeaks poll about collaborating with tech companies, I voted yes as it is in the public interest, WikiLeaks though should attempt to protect themselves as collaborating with tech companies can open up critisism of favouritism or/and 'aiding the enemy' since the USG definition of 'enemy' is so ad hoc (see Mannings trial). I think it is of use to ask that tech firms form consortium with committment to share fixes on an open bases and not to use this for competitive advantage over others in this way there is true public benefit. As long as the Grand Jury is ongoing How can WL share these 'CIA cyber guns' with the 'CIA Targets' - the tech companies- Only when the Grand Jury is disbanded and tech world stands up for WL can sharing the tools be perhaps safe for WL, in any case is good to find out what people think."

10770,"[2017-03-11 03:16:15] <Emmy B> I did not know this about Jacob's lawyers. The thing is perhaps she does not realise but at the Democracy Now interview (a broadcaster with obvious affinity and sympathy towards WikiLeaks), to the average viewer she comes across as 'covering up' for the CIA. In comparison, speaking to AP (generally hostile to WL) she is more willing to contribute to the debate and clear she views aspects of the release as positive and in line with EFF's consumer privacy objectives if nothing else."
10771,"[2017-03-11 03:19:20] <Emmy B> We are 'political animals', she is acting 'politically' but perhaps, to my mind, compromising her function at the EFF due to her affiliations or personal bias.

I think most people are against that stupid Mexican wall thing. Women's groups are generally up in arms re Trump, I'm still wondering why they weren't the same re Bill Clinton. The fight over the pipeline still ongoing. No one has a clue what's going to happen re Obamacare. And generally we all knew we were spied on anyway and no one ever liked the CIA, so I suspect the average person's response is 'so what's new?' Sad, but I had kinds thought the same thing."

10825,"[2017-03-24 07:30:34] <Emmy B> [Card-player] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJvHxmYAXo @ wikileaks no doubt the interference with the press conference yesterday had a qualitative effect on it. Even the audio recordings circulating in you tube without the pauses are of doubly poor quality since by removing the pauses caused by the interference the audio has the appearance of a normal essay type monologue but of course if you are trying to pay attention and understand what is being said the interruptions are evident, although by first appearance not so easily detected due to the JA's naturally steady tone of speech. For someone who perhaps may not have been aware with the interference and interruptions during the live transmission and hears the audio recording for example here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpJvHxmYAXo"
10826,[2017-03-24 07:51:49] <WikiLeaks> It's a war. They hacked the three press conference systems last tuesday.
10827,"[2017-03-24 08:14:18] <Emmy B> I see! it is the hardest of conditions still it did take place which was great, despite the problems. Old fashion technology as back up for the after event dissemination of information is important as journo's reporting on this would want easy to copy quotes from JA. This release will be revisited for many months to come, and as the different parts of the release go ahead interest will fluctuate but progressively increase, so plan B (old fashion technology for a back up recording of the press conference not a bad idea) JA is right that tech co's and tech journals/journalists reporting on the matter tend to ignore the political aspect of the issue, and so the analysis provided by WL during the press conference, bringing everything together (technical, political, geopolitical, legal) it is of great value in sparking discussions. Also, perhaps consider, at a time when the release is a bit further down, a round table discussion post publication with small number of ppl reviewing the releases so far, not live (no avoid interference), pre-recorded but with the possibility of going over the material and reviewing its impact (Brexit Club style but only 30-60 min long) of course it is easy for me to say... anyways we continue to be amazed at WL efforts to prevail no matter what so keep it up <3"

For the people directly involved it is tragic, for the rest of us, well it diverts from the power political nature of the story into yet again sex and its politics.

It's not even a pure fact versus dramatic presentation difference, much in pediatrics is based on limited evidence and clinician judgement, but just just an ethos of personal responsibility and trust when what you do and say impacts people's lives.

On the other hand it will be very interesting to see post elections results which French Media will report what from the emails and weather they will 'ethically' self censor."
10963,"[2017-05-05 19:17:15] <Emmy B> if Ukraine is instrumentalised to influence communication policy in EU in the same manner it has been used to influence military strategy, Cyber warfare strategy will also be steared in the same direction. In the absence of a Britain stearing EU policy the US way due to its weakened Brexit position, Macron may yet play that role in the meanwhile, I mean, when did an Obama endorsed a French presidential candidate the eve of both first and second rounds. The snug is that EU/US policy in the Ukraine has brought about a civil war in that country, if now Ukraine has been instrumentalised to destabilise the EU then what is the expression? ""the chickens have come home to roost"""

11074,[2017-05-23 15:34:19] <Emmy B> one of the many stories in the book of WikiLeaks
11075,[2017-05-24 07:49:54] <Emmy B> My son's school cancelled school trip to the National Gallery today because of 'tourirism' how rare we can get an accidental smile out of this hysteria
11076,"[2017-05-24 21:43:17] <Emmy B> Millitaire.gr reports US Admin has requested extended military co-operation btw US GR with focus on upgrading military facilities in the AEGEAN in view of the (now agreed) all NATO offensive on ISIS. A US delegation will visit military facilities in the Aegean. In other articles notes that US interest has been up till now limited and focused on Greece's Souda bay with developing US Naval facilities in Crete, now the focus will include other islands too, mentions Turkey's unreliability as a partner for a reason, but of course I see an increased US military presence in the Aegean as strategically controlling the straights into Black see and the Russian fleet stationed there, perhaps limiting its involvement in Syria in support of Assad. Reminder that Nato has already been deployed in the Aegean 'to control refugee flows from Turkey' albeit obliged Turkey with avoiding South East part as Turkey claims should be de-militarised due to Lozane treatie and other accords (Greece has militarised parts of the aegean since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus). Also reports US pressures GR to sign 5 yr rolling accord for the use of Suda to the annually re-newed agreement in place claiming this would allow them to invest further on their Naval base."
11077,"[2017-05-24 21:47:18] <Emmy B> Noting that UK MOD recently stated RAF upgraded runway and other facilities in their military sovereign base areas in Cyprus and statement that by 2019 it will be the largest UK deployment abroad, we are in for escalation of conflict in the Middle East."
11078,[2017-05-24 21:51:55] <Emmy B> Greece is a reluctant party and will resist its own military taking any part other than medical/humanitarian as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan but it's proximity to the area and the use of it's facilities clearly it involves the entire country in the adventurism perils of Western geopolitics. Trump's Tomahokes (however you spell them) were anchored at Suda prior to deployment.
11079,"[2017-05-24 22:00:37] <Emmy B> Britain's divide and rule policy in Cyprus eloquently expressed in the 1960 terms of 'independence' (that truly never was) continued by US's Kissinger endorsement and assistance in Turkey's military invasion in 1974 (with signals assistance from US station in Crete and Israel's signals too) leaves Greece with no doubt on how determined to harm, its 'allies' are.

11085,[2017-05-24 22:53:01] <Emmy B> (pincus much?) good morning __
11086,[2017-05-28 13:31:52] <Emmy B> I have come across something strange perhaps WL needs to take a look. The BBC have changed the content of one of their articles completely from 29.05.2012 and recycling part of the content in a new article dated 19.05.2017 with the same URL as the old one. I found this as I attempted to archive the new article at archive.is and got the message that this url has already been archived. Why would the BBC do this? in effect the original article has now been censored. I saved the new article on wayback machine as not to interfere with the archive.is record.
11087,[2017-05-28 13:33:27] <Emmy B> This is the new article: https://web.archive.org/web/20170528202409/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11047811
11088,[2017-05-28 13:34:03] <Emmy B> [Card-summary] http://archive.is/ED8x This is the old article:
11089,"[2017-05-28 13:39:08] <Emmy B> just noticed the wayback machine has 158 captures of the same URL, it is JA's profile article which constantly changes, so it must be their policy to not change the URL, just like the Wikipedia policy, same URL different content."

Harrods might now be boycotted by other Arabs affecting the bottom line? What will be UK's stance on this M.E. crisis. There is one factor that has not been substantially taken into account, Al Jazeera and its reach to Western audiences. An important week. Fingers crossed."
11093,[2017-06-05 09:40:06] <Emmy B> Egypt has asked from Greece to be its diplomatic representative in Qatar whilst the diplomatic relations are severed btw the two nations. Greece has always enjoyed very good relations with Egypt but the choice is perhaps an indication of a soft approach to this crisis. Egypt Israel Greece and Cyprus have been coming closer as they have been collaborating in demarcating/recognising eachother's economic zones in East Med in relation to monetising recently discovered gas reserves in East Med. Who will Turkey represent I wonder?

Well it is the first time I see US Deep state doing their job so openly and to see all 5 eyes under the CIA direction against the Potus is very interesting. Of course Trump politically is very rightwing, not of my persuasion, but what we see here is the cancelling of politics, when CIA is in cahoots with the Democrat &amp; Republican establishment to get rid of Trump. Imagine what they must have threatened Obama with... we'll never know."

11274,[2017-07-11 14:06:34] <WISE Up Action> Seems like some on-going battles /struggles around Trump circle.
11275,"[2017-07-11 14:22:01] <Emmy B> In Greece US secret services possibly with other collaborators planned an assassination plan (Pythia) against Right-Wing PM Kostas Karamanlis (it links with the 2004-2005 unlawful interception scandal - The Athens Affair) due to his re-approachment with Russia. Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don't know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the 'centre left' PASOK headed by Clinton's friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the 'No' referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning 'Pythia', at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country. They did it with impunity to Greece why they won't do it to America? Perhaps they always did it but were not found out, now everyone can see (not the details of it) but it is so obvious CIA and the rest of them meddle."

11297,[2017-07-19 15:53:32] <Emmy B> All I got were one liners from the London Mayor! *not happy*
11298,[2017-07-19 23:57:07] <Emmy B> Answer 1 - The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
11299,"<p>As you may be aware there is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it."
11300,<p>The MPS will provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence.
11301,[2017-07-19 23:57:43] <Emmy B> Answer 2 - The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
11302,"<p>Julian Assange is subject to arrest under the Bail Act, for breach of conditions laid by the High Court."
11303,<p>This is an operational matter for the MPS who are keeping the situation under review.
11304,[2017-07-19 23:58:48] <Emmy B> Answer 3 - The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
11305,<p>The allegation that the MPS have spent tens of millions of pounds spying on Julian Assange is incorrect.
11306,"<p>There is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it. This is an operational matter for the police who are continuing to review the situation."
11307,[2017-07-19 23:59:30] <Emmy B> Answer 4 - The Mayor (13-Jul-2017)
11308,<p>The MPS have not engaged any private police contractors operating in the surrounding streets of the Ecuadorian embassy.
11309,<p>Organisations or communities may fund their own security patrols and the MPS will work with personnel in the most appropriate way to prevent and detect crime.
11310,[2017-07-20 00:01:07] <Emmy B> Question 4 was - David Kurten (13-Jul-2017)
11311,"<p>Is the Mayor aware of private police contractors operating in Hans Crescent, Basil Street, and surrounding area of Knightsbridge, are they licenced and what is their exact role?"
11312,[2017-07-20 00:04:11] <Emmy B> The answer did not really answer the question so it could be an 'organisation' or 'community' exists that employs private police contractors or security patrols. If they Mayor will not disclose how can I find out?
11313,[2017-07-20 00:04:38] <Emmy B> The Council? The Home Office? a FOIR?
11314,"[2017-07-20 02:41:24] <WikiLeaks> They should hammer them for the ""not tens of millions"" when they themselves said 12.6 million in 2015"
11315,[2017-07-20 03:02:01] <Emmy B> Yes!
11316,"[2017-07-21 06:02:36] <Emmy B> In the Aspen Security video that WikiLeaks shared today in its timeline, Pompeo mentions that the name of a CIA agent was published which he found unconscionable, to lukewarm applause, when the interviewer asked him 'Do you talk about Phil Agee?"" he says ""Excuse me?"" the interviewer repeats the name and Pompeo says ""I'm sorry I don't know that name"". Well in his anti-WL speech in April at CSiS https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2017-speeches-testimony/pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html"
11317,[2017-07-21 06:04:00] <Emmy B> Who wrote his speech? obviously not himself returning from a trip to London that day.
11318,[2017-07-21 06:05:09] <WikiLeaks> Well spotted. He is not referring to Agee but a NYT reporter.
11319,"[2017-07-21 06:16:33] <Emmy B> Embarrassing I thought, some people laughed but probably because they knew who Phillip Agee was. I can understand that perhaps Pompeo was not on best form, but for sure that April speech was not written by him otherwise he would have immediately picked up on the name and say something ' no not him' etc. The interviewer made references to his April speech about WikiLeaks earlier in this interview, so, Pompeo surely would have the April speech fresh in his mind, it did not happen a lifetime away. I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep. And perhaps wanting to capitalise on Trump's public opposition to Cuba. Trying to pass Trump &amp; his supporters the message that ""I love WikiLeaks"" is certainly in the same category/trench as Cuban loving Agee. Who knows."
